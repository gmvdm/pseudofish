Another [brilliant interview][] over at DrunkenBlog. Go check it out.
Wil Shipley speaks on software, Apple, Cocoa and life.

One of my favourite bits:

> Making a simple user interface is a thousand times harder than a
> complicated one. I could literally write a skeleton of Delicious
> Library in a day, if I weren't worried about how all the buttons and
> fields interacted or looked. Adding the fun to the app is the hard
> thing ...
