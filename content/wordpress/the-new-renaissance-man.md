The book [In Search of Excellence][] (by [Tom Peters][] and [Robert
Waterman][]) mentions work by Stanford's Harold Leavitt on the
management process. According to Leavitt, the managing process is an
interactive flow of three variables:

</p>

-   path finding
-   decision making
-   implementation

</p>

At the time of writing, 1982, the focus on management was rational and
analytic approaches to decision making. The other two variables being
neglected by so called *professional managers*.

</p>

To provide example, several types of people were associated with each
category.

</p>

*Path Finding*: poets, artists, entrepreneurs, and leaders who have put
their personal stamp on some business.

</p>

*Decision Making*: systems analysts, engineers, MBAs, statisticians, and
professional managers.

</p>

*Implementation*: psychologists, salesmen, teachers, social workers, and
most Japanese managers -- essentially those who get their kicks from
working with other people.

</p>

The obvious point from all of this is that a manager needs a broad
spread of skills across all of these areas. To be successful as a
manager implies a generalist approach, with skills in many diverse
areas, a focus on people and the ability to execute ideas -- a
Renaissance Man (or person in modern parlance).
