There is something in the water up here. The economy seems to be going well,
and the press seems to have taken notice.

An
[example](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/02/16/klarna-spotify-mysql-king-dice-izettle/1923609/)
from USA Today:

>  If music service Spotify landed Stockholm on the high-tech map, companies
>  such as Klarna underscore its growing influence.

>  In the first quarter of 2012, Sweden took in almost 20% of all venture
>  capital invested in the European Union, trailing only Germany

And Pando Daily on
[Stockholm](http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/20/why-tiny-stockholm-has-the-most-stunning-startup-ecosystem-since-tel-aviv/):

> Thanks to Klarna, Spotify, Rebtel, and King.com, among others, Stockholm has
> a longer history of tech successes and more big-dollar exits than its German
> rival [Berlin].

> For instance, the Nordic region as a whole — which still represents a
> much smaller population than Germany — accounted for about 6.5 percent of
> the world’s billion-dollar exits from 2005 to 2012, according to statistics
> provided by Stockholm-based venture capital firm Creandum.


There is still room to grow, as European startups in general are
[undervalued](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/02/16/european-startups-need-to-be-celebrated-for-success/)
compared to the US:

> Listed European technology firms valued at more than $100 million are on
> average 32 percent cheaper than their North American peers. Bloomberg says
> they trade at an average ratio of 15 times earnings compared with 22 times
> earnings in the US and Canada.

The Economist goes into depth on in their special report on
[The Nordic Lights](http://www.economist.com/printedition/2013-02-02):

> Finland has become much more market- and entrepreneur-friendly. It has
> produced an impressive number of start-ups, including 300 founded by former
> Nokia employees.

And:

> The Nordic countries have not only largely escaped the economic problems that
> are convulsing the Mediterranean world; they have also largely escaped the
> social ills that plague America.


I feel very lucky to have worked for a number of Nordic companies, and to
continue my Scandinavian adventure with Spotify here in Stockholm.
