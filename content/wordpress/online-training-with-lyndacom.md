With my CS4 registration, Adobe gave me one month of a [Lynda.com][]
subscription. I didn't think this would be useful, and was expecting to
learn a few things. Turns out, it's been immensely useful.

I recommend trying it for a month. My current plan is to buy a month
subscription one every year or so. Or maybe every six months.

I consider myself reasonably effective with Photoshop and the digital
darkroom, yet still learnt many new processes and techniques for
producing a completed photograph. The following courses were interesting
or inspirational:

-   [Douglas Kirkland: Creative Inspiration][]
-   [Photoshop CS4 Retouching: Fashion Photography Projects][]
-   [Beyond Skin: Going Deeper with Photoshop CS3][]

I also updated a few other Adobe applications, such as InDesign and
learnt some Flash basics too:

-   [Designing a Magazine Layout Hands-On Workshop][]
-   [InDesign CS4: 10 Habits of Highly Effective Pros][]
-   [Flash CS4 Professional Essential Training][]

There are other online video learning sites, such as [Kelby Training][],
that are also worth a look. The important bit is to keep updating your
skills and improving your workflow.
