I'm recently become quite excited about printing my photos. So much so
that I've bought an A4 photo printer for "proofing". For high quality
prints, I'd rather outsource to a professional lab. The information on
which ones are in Melbourne is a bit scattered, thus this list.

</p>

Melbourne labs:

</p>

-   [Bond Imaging][] – Richmond (*quote on request*)
-   [CPL Digital][] – St Kilda ([price list][])
-   [Digital Works][] – Hallam ([price list][1])
-   [Lab X][] – St Kilda ([price list][2])
-   [NuLab][] – Braeside (*price list on registration*)
-   [Vanbar Imaging][] – Carlton / North Melbourne ([price list][3])

</p>

To get the most out of a good photo lab, or any photo lab, you need to
be using a colour managed workflow. This should include proofing in
Photoshop based on the colour profile of the print device. If the lab
can not supply a way of colour matching to their printer, you may want
to consider another lab.

*Disclaimer*: I'm not affiliated with any of these labs. I actually
haven't used most of them, so if you have recommendations, please leave
a comment.
