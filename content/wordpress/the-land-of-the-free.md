> Governments argue that desperate times demand such remedies. They face

> old rules and freedoms out of date. Besides, does not international

> Human rights are part of what it means to be civilised. Locking up

> paedophiles, too?—before they commit crimes would probably make
> society safer. Dozens of plots may have been foiled and thousands of
> lives saved as a result of some of the unsavoury practices now being
> employed in the name of fighting terrorism. Dropping such practices in
> order to preserve freedom may cost many lives. So be it.
