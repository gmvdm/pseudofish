[Media 09][] is a new media conference held in Sydney. I attended last
year's, and missed this year due to being in Canada. Fortunately, Brad
from [lagrangepoint][] was there and blogged many of the talks.

Below are some of the highlights from his coverage (click through for
full articles):

<p>
**[Brian McCarthy][]**, Fairfax CEO:

> In discussing the media environment, he pointed out the differences
> between the US and Australia, including the greater investment in
> colour printing and the more discreet geographic distribution of our
> population that has protected Australian publishers.
>
> He also reiterated his faith in content - and **quality journalism** -
> being the key to survival, as the company continues to **merge its
> print and online** offerings and diversify into new markets

</p>

<p>
**[Caroline Little][]**, from The Guardian News and Media USA:

> The role of the newspaper as a record of **yesterday's news** has
> gone, and newsrooms need to adapt.
>
> The newspaper is now no longer the most effective means for an
> advertiser to reach an audience, with the market becoming **more
> fragmented**.
>
> She said there are four key areas - multimedia storytelling, database
> journalism, reader engagement and citizen journalism. Fear of failure
> must not hold proprietors back.
>
> Understanding **Twitter** and **Facebook** are vital for understanding
> engagement and their viral nature, and it is important to understand
> how content is being distributed away from the publisher's website.

</p>

<p>
**[Nic Newman][]**, BBC:

> Content must also be made sharable, within the boudaries of content
> rights, via widgets and other portals so that content gets to where
> the audience actually is.

</p>

**[Ben Self][]**, used social media for the Obama campaign:

> There were more than 1800 videos distributed to supporters, and 50
> million views of this content. 68 million Americans were reached
> either online or in person throughout the campaign. More than US$770
> million was raised - US$500 million raised online.
>
> He said that having a dynamic and interesting **email** program **was
> crucial**, with more than 13 million on the distribution list by the
> end of the campaign. They also made it easier for people to
> communicate themselves through the web site.
>
> He also looked at tools to **target** and organise voters
> **geographically**, to help get people in neighbourhoods together who
> want to be part of the campaign.
>
</p>
<p>
**[Meg Pickard][]**, The Guardian Community manager:

> "We didnt make any money, but we generated an enormous amount of
> **goodwill**," Pickard said. "We sold several hundred, but we had
> seveal thousand people linking to it on **Facebook**."
>
> There is a wholly trinity of **technology, people and editorial**. She
> also talked about the transition from casual users to connected users,
> committed users and finally **catalysts** - the final category being
> the ones who represented less than 1 percent of the audience, but are
> blogging and twittering about you, saving stories on del.ico.us and
> creating pages on Facebook, that you need to find a way to engage
> with.

**[Richard Cardran][],** Emmy award winner for his work in digital
media:

> Cardran says we have reached a point of maturity, to the point where
> if a business doesn't have strategies in business for Facebook,
> MySpace or mobile, then they really should, because all it takes now
> is willpower.
>
> Cardran says you need a strategy for **ecosystem** and for
> **syndication**, and that leads to a meta strategy. He spoke about
> creating value around an object, service or presence, not the object,
> service or presence itself.
>
> End users should be allowed to design custom **virtual newspapers and
> magazines**, and they should be able to virally distribute their
> custom publications. He says newspapers should also create
> **hyper-localised** applications to exploit **local advertising
> revenue**.
