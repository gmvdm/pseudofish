WSDL is useful in the enterprise space where toolsets do most of the
heavy lifting, but it really is too much hard work to write WSDL from
scratch. [Tim Bray][] muses about how WSDL could be improved, likening
it to SGML for complexity and asking what the XML simplification would
be.

Update: [Dion Hinchcliffe][] has provided a good summary of the various
alternatives that are in the wings at the moment.

There is a lot happening in this space, even if it is getting confusing.
I've just been to a seminar where ["AJAX"][] was quoted as the *new* web
service. Amusing given how it is just the result of gluing together
existing technologies in an [interesting][] way.
