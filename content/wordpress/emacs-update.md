Now that Iâ€™ve been using Emacs for a while, I'm finding that my reflexes
are adjusting to the Emacs way. On the bright side, I can still jump
back into Vim and be productive.

A [recent blog][] post highlighted the areas that I still need to
explore.

I'm finding the deeper I dive into Emacs use, the more there is to find.
The idea of a [30 day challenge][] to use nothing but Emacs is going [a
bit far][], however I do find myself using it for more and more things.

Originally my focus was on Clojure, due to the great Lisp integration. I
even have the keyboard shortcuts for [Paredit mode][] as the background
image on my screen. Now, I also use it for note taking and for
organising ideas before preparing presentations. Rails coding is also
emacs friendly.

A pleasant surprise is just how many controls and tools support emacs
key bindings. Almost every textbox on Mac OS X for example. Typically, I
make use of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E to jump to the beginning and ends of lines,
and Ctrl-D to forward delete a character.

The one area I still tend to fall back to Vim with is managing servers.
I think I need some more practice with keyboard combos on terminals. I
am also still to really learn emacs' lisp.

Overall, I'm very happy with the switch.
