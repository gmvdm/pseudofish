The quote above is from a [recent][] episode of the [LightSource][]
podcast, where [Kirk Voclain][] shares his secrets with Bill and Ed.
Kirk identifies his inspiration for lighting to be the late Dean
Collins.

</p>

I originally heard about [Dean Collins][] courtesy of David Hobby's
[Strobist][] site. I've come to trust David's recommendations, so when
he was enthusiastic about the [Dean Collins DVDs][] they were an instant
purchase.

</p>

Having watched the four DVDs through, the way in which I see is altered.
Not just when I'm looking through the viewfinder, but in day to day
life.

</p>

I notice more about lighting. Looking at other's photography, I'm seeing
how things are lit. These were skills I was starting to develop thanks
to David, and Dean's videos took things rapidly to the next level.

</p>

I've noticed is that it isn't just the situations that I'm controlling
the light where things have improved - my photography in general has
improved. My hypothesis is that by learning how to control light, you
also develop better vision for how light falls. This means that my
natural light photography has improved as a result of learning the
basics of studio lighting.

</p>

For me, Dean Collins is the best teacher of lighting I've come across.
The modern teachers of lighting I found that are good? They learnt from
Dean Collins.

</p>

If you are just getting into lighting, start by reading through the
[Strobist][] site and listening to the [LightSource][1] back catalog.
Once your interest is piqued, the [Dean Collins DVDs][] can provide the
next step up.
