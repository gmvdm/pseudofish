Title: Safari 3.0 and Taboo

In the old days, before 3.0, Safari had an annoying habit. If you
pressed Cmd-Q with many windows and tabs open, then Safari would quit.
This could be incredibly frustrating; especially when you accidentally
pressed Q instead of W.

</p>

[Taboo][], a questionable [InputManager hack][], provided a work around.

</p>

Safari 3.0 fixes it properly. Apple has included the option of prompting
the user on close if multiple tabs or windows are open.

</p>

However, if Taboo is still installed, you cannot close top level
windows.

</p>

Taboo lives in one of the following two directories.

</p>
<p>
    ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins

</p>

Remove it, and Safari 3.0 will work as intended.
