I've blogged about [management][] before, and still don't have any
answers. What I do have, is a range of ways of improving.

</p>

1.  </p>

    Mentoring -- Learn from others.

    </p>

    You don't need to have a formal mentor relationship; you don't even
    need someone's permission to learn from them. What you need is to
    identify one or more people who have managed you well, or who you
    respect the way they manage others.

    </p>

    Spent time with these people!

    </p>

    Odds are, someone who is good at managing people, is happy to
    receive help. Offer to help out. Show interest in their problems
    and, most importantly, how they deal with them. Offer suggestions.
    You will learn in spite of yourself, just don't expect to be right
    most of the time.

    </p>

    If you aren't in a position to offer suggestions, at least think of
    decisions you would make in a similar situation, and why. You may
    not always agree with the resultant decision, and it is worth
    investigating why you differ. Mentors are human too, and you can
    learn from their mistakes as well as your own.

    </p>

2.  </p>

    History -- You are not the first.

    </p>

    People have gone before you, some were good, some were bad, many
    wrote books. Find them.

    </p>

    Your mentors may be able to recommend people to start with. Read
    blogs of people you respect, and find out who they recommend.

    </p>

    If in doubt, start with [Peter Drucker][].

    </p>

    Another good approach is to check the references and notes sections
    of management or business books you are reading. If there is a key
    point that resonates with you, often there is another book or
    article waiting in the wings to expand your knowledge.

    </p>
    <p>
3.  </p>

    Current practices -- Things change.

    </p>

    Management continues to evolve in terms of what works. New theories
    come and go. Changing dynamics of the work force introduces new
    challenges. Keep up to date on current thinking.

    </p>

    Books are a good source of knowledge for this. Try and find books
    recommended by others.

    </p>

    One that I've found useful recently is [Evidence Based
    Management][]. The key thing from this book is a way of filtering
    out other business related knowledge.

    </p>

    Business magazines may assist with current trends. This is not a
    path I've followed. Although, I do read the Economist - a magazine
    that does a good job of tracking the business world as well as world
    events.

    </p>

    Blogs provide lots of opinion on a range of current topics.
    Subscribe to ones that interest you, and also subscribe to ones that
    challenge you.

    </p>
    <p>
4.  </p>

    Experience -- Learn by doing.

    </p>

    Whether your are in an official position of management or simply
    working in a team, try out what you've learnt. You will make
    mistakes, it is part of the process. The aim is to learn from your
    previous experiences, be they successful or not.

    </p>

    Volunteer for tasks outside your normal scope of work that will
    allow you to develop. This provides a good way of gaining a range of
    experience in more than just your domain. The experiences will help
    you in your own domain.

    </p>
    <p>
5.  </p>

    Diversity -- management is all about people. All the theory and best
    practices in the world won't help if you can't work with people.

    </p>

    Spend time having interests outside of work, you will become more
    approachable. More importantly, spend time finding out what other
    people's interests are.

    </p>

    A clich√©d book perhaps, but Dale Carnegie's [How to Win Friends &
    Influence People][] is the definitive book on interacting with
    others.

    </p>

6.  </p>

    Podcasts -- A free lunch.

    </p>

    With the advent of podcasting, people are giving away knowledge. You
    can listen to interviews with founders of successful companies,
    lectures from the best universities and a constant stream of news.

    </p>

    The following podcasts I've found useful and inspiring, ordered
    roughly in terms of utility:

    </p>

    -   [Stanford][] - lecture series on entrepreneurship, that covers
        leadership and management.

    -   [Venture Voice][] - interview series that covers how business
        owners manage their companies and the people who work for them.

    -   [Harvard][] - bi-weekly broadcast that covers topical areas in
        business, including reviews of recently released books.
    -   [12 Byzantine Rulers][] - history of how the leaders of the
        Byzantine empire dealt with the management of the entire empire.
        Provides a good historical perspective.

    -   [Knowledge@Wharton][] - another business news podcast from the
        business school at Wharton.

    </p>

</p>

For a closing truism -- the more you learn, the more you'll know, thus
the more effective you'll become. Stay open to learning new things,
however you learn them.

If you have an experience to share, or an avenue of knowledge that has
worked for you, please leave a comment.
