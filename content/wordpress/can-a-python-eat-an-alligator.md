The answer is maybe. [Fox news][] has an interesting story about pythons
in the Everglades.

</p>

It turns out that the question is less than rhetorical and that a python
attempted to consume an alligator. Unfortunately for the python, it
exploded in the process.

My favourite quote goes to:

It is starting to remind me of a [recent film][] with the tagline:
