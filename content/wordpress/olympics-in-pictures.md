I wasn't hugely interested in the Olympics from a sporting perspective.
I'm more a Winter Olympics kinda guy. However, I've found myself
enthralled by the lengths taken by photographers to capture the games.

The main entry point is [Vincent Laforet][]'s blog. He's an experienced
photographer and is sharing his thought processes as he covers the games
for Newsweek.

Newsweek have taken an interesting approach and sent three photographers
to shot the games and to blog about it. Their combined blog is [here][].
[This article][] is a good example of the kinds of information being
posted. The editor also selects a photo for the day.

Reuter's [photo blog][] is also featuring an Olympic photo of the day
from their photographers.

I'm learning a lot about sport photography and photography in general by
reading through these, especially Vincent's musings. I now have
enthusiasm for the Olympics.
