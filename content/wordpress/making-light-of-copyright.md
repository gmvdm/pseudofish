In [Lightroom][], I want to set some metadata on [import][]. The tricky
bit is entering the copyright symbol, on both Mac and PC.

The aim is to enter something like:

On Mac OS X, use the following key combination:

<p>
    Option + g

</p>

Under Windows, there are a few options. The most compatible is to hold
down Alt and type 0169 on the numeric keyboard. In some word processors,
you can use the key combination Ctrl+Alt+C.

</p>

Entering this into the metadata form, storing it as a preset and using
it on import means that all my photos are now automatically tagged. On
export Lightroom will optionally put the copyright message as an
overlay.

</p>

<u>Bonus</u>: for HTML, try &copy;
