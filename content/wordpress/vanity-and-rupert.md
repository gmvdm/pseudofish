[Rupert Murdoch][] opens up to Vanity Fair's Michael Wolff as background
for an upcoming biography. The [article][Rupert Murdoch] provides great
insight to the man and, by proxy, the companies he runs.

> But his odd lack of seductiveness or felicitousness—contributing to
> his aura of villainy—became after a while alluring in itself. There’s
> no spin, because he really can’t explain himself. Rather, what you see
> is what you get. He’s transparent. The nature of the beast is entirely
> evident.

> ...

> There is at News Corp. never a discussion of Murdoch’s exit. It is
> referred to only as “in 30 or 40 years,” when he is gone—which may
> have started as an amusing locution, but is now a practiced and even
> official one. His existential predicament is, in other words, his own.

The [Guardian][] also has a good [piece][Guardian] on the *Battle
Royale* that is brewing between the new WSJ and the New York Times, and
why it may no longer matter.

> Murdoch fell into conversation with Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of
> the Journal's arch-rival, the New York Times. By buying the Journal,
> Murdoch had parked his tanks directly on the NYT's lawn. What, people
> wondered, would the two make of each other?
