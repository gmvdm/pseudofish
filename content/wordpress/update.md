It's been a while since I posted, due to a few other things going on. I
also have a couple of articles in the wings that are waiting for me to
finish.

On another note, Apple has [dropped support][] for the Java-Objective C
bridge. What this means is that if you were using Java for Cocoa
development you are now out in the cold. This could lead to more people
using Python or Ruby for Cocoa development.
