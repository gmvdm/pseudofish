The 5D Mark II is one heck of a camera and puts Canon back in the game
at the semi-pro level.

I was all set to buy the original 5D after its price dropped with the
release of the new one. I also considered selling all my Canon gear to
get the D700. I'm glad I waited.

The new revision has some grand features:

-   21 megapixel, full-frame CMOS sensor
-   ISO 100 - 6400 (extendable to ISO 50 - 25600)
-   HD Movie recording and HDMI out
-   3.9 frames per second continuous shooting

The addition that would have been nice is an improved max sync speed.
1/200 is a bit slow. ISO 50 helps, but it would be even better if max
sync could get to 1/250 or 1/320.

The video samples are not exciting, but are beautiful quality. If only
[Chase Jarvis][] was shooting Canon gear. Not that it matters, the new
5D will sell by the truck load.
