If you're interested in typography, odds are you've already read [The
Elements of Typographic Style][].

If you're not interested in typography, design, fonts, or any related
area, skip the book. However, you may still find the turn of phrase in
the following quote to be interesting.

> ... setting type is a collaborative exercise, like acting from a
> script or playing from a score. The editing of type, like the editing
> of music, and the tuning of fonts, like the tuning of instruments,
> never ends.
>
> There are those who dream of a perfect world in which copyrighted text
> is translated into copyrighted glyphs through copyrighted rules with
> no more human intervention than it takes to feed a tape to a machine,
> while money flows in perpetuity to everyone involved. There are also
> those that think that putting chairs and air-conditioners in hell will
> make it just as good as heaven. Actually, working with type is an
> earthly task, much less like sitting down and turning on TV than like
> walking on your hands across an ever-varied, never-ending landscape
> that is otherwise too far away to see.
