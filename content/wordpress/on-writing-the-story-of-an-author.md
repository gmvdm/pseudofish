I grew up reading. Reading lots. As a child, Mum would take me to the
local library to borrow books; ten at a time. I read everything I could
find, sci-fi, adventure, books on chess openings.

The genre I loved most was horror. It felt like I was being led into a
world I wasn't supposed to be in. A door left ajar, and I snuck in
without anyone realizing. Authors like [James Herbert][], [Dean
Koontz][], and [Stephen King][].

The book I'm reading now is a gripping story by Stephen King, [On
Writing][]. Not a fiction story, but rather a tale of how he became an
author and how he writes his novels. Part autobiographical, part
instruction, all interesting.

> that I'm aware of, no shortcut.

This theory is one of the reasons I blog. It gives me a reason to
practice writing. Often. The surprise is that it has also increased the
amount I read, to the point of requiring investment in more shelf space
for books.

On Writing is filled with gems of practical information and inspiration
to get started. It helps that the book itself is well written, a good
test for a tomb on the craft itself. What to leave out is mentioned; how
to avoid too much detail.
