If you have ever tried JavaScript programming, you know how painful it
is. You can not help but be impressed by [Bob Ippolito's][] work on
bringing [MochiKit][] together. Useful on its own, and extremely good as
part of [TurboGears][]. To quote:

> MochiKit makes JavaScript suck less

> MochiKit is a highly documented and well tested, suite of JavaScript
> libraries that will help you get shit done, fast. We took all the good
> ideas we could find from our Python, Objective-C, etc. experience and
> adapted it to the crazy world of JavaScript.

Watch the [screencast][] to see how easy JavaScript programming can be.
