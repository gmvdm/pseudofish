Title: Tracking a Hen's Tooth

Ever since February in Florida, I've wanted a [Burton Zoom][] backpack.

It started as [Transworld's][] fault. They pitched it as the best option
to carry photography gear to the snow. They are almost right; there are
two options: the [Burton Zoom][] and the [Dakine Sequence][]. Both are
much of a muchness, and the only back country packs that will safely
carry a snowboard *and* heap of camera stuff.

Things started going wrong on entry to Canada. Tracked down my favorite
Burton store ... Out of stock. Had them ring around for me, and it turns
out Burton was out. They were very helpful and suggest I check online.
All online stores, all of in North America, were Out of stock. My best
bet ... the start of the Australian season.

For almost two months, Trigger Brothers in St Kilda have tried to track
one down for me through their Burton rep. Today, they gave me a list of
their competitors that would be most likely to have one. The last name
on the list, Mordy Surf, hit pay dirt. There was one left in their
Camberwell store. Only one. Put on hold. For me!

A hasty exit from work, and a zoomy drive to Camberwell and the quest
has finally reached an end. To the best of my knowledge, it was the last
one in Melbourne.

Expect lots of random snow photos on [flickr][] this winter!
