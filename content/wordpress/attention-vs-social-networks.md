Insight into the world of online networks:

> The world is not an undirected graph and very little about social life
> online is actually undirected. Many social relations are unequal; they
> are rooted in directional graphs - fandom, power, hierarchy. So why do

In an [article][] by [Zephoria][], a very interesting person with a lot
to say. Found via an undirected link to a neighbor in my [last.fm][]
listings.

ps. for pimping last.fm, see Fred Wilson's [comments][].
