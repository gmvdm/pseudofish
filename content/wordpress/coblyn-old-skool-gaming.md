[Coblyn][![Coblyn4t][]] is just released for Mac OS X. A combination of
puzzle solving and action, harks back to the computing days of old. If
you loved [Boulder Dash][], check it out.

The neat thing is that the user manual includes details on how to create
levels. The site also includes a bonus pack of 200 classic levels.
