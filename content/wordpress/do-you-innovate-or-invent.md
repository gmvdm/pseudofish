From the perspective of an entrepreneur, an idea on its own is not worth
much. To be valuable, the idea has to be nurtured through to a product
or a process, and then on to adoption by your end users.

In the "*Web 2.0*" world, there are lots of new ideas, but very few
gaining particular traction.

Andrew has an interesting [article][] examining the difference between
an invention and an innovation:

> Inventors must start with a world of possibilities and work to create
> new ideas, patents, prototypes or processes, and propose that other
> people should consider their contribution to the world (often through
> publication). Innovators take a possibility or idea, often one that
> inventors have already proposed, and turn that into something that
> they follow through to adoption.

Which are you working on?
