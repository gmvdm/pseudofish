The amount of comment spam has been rising rapidly, even with efforts to
[reduce][] the tide. As a result, I weighed up the benefits of comments
(again).

I still see the benefits in letting people comment on posts, so comments
will stay, but I need a way of reducing the amount of comment spam.
Playing around with Wordpress plug-ins, I'm going to try something
different - a web service.

[Akismet][] essentially outsources the problem to someone else. Free for
[personal use][], signing up is a matter of getting a wordpress.com
username, which supplies a key.

Some stats from their site, as of January 22, 2007:

> 601,615,558 spams caught so far
>
> 113,265 so far today
>
> 94% of all comments are spam

Given the recent comments I've seen, the 94% number is, if anything,
low.
