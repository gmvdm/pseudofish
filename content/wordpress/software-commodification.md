Not so long ago...

-   a web server was a large piece of software requiring large expensive
    hardware to run.

    Now one is deployed with all major operating systems, and can be
    embedded into applications.

-   a database server required a team of people to maintain and a
    dedicated server.

    Now it is possible to embed one into your application. (Apple does
    it for you with [Core Data][]).

-   a web browser was a hard fought venture.

    Now a browser is a control that is [embedded][] into many different
    applications.

Things that were once big are now available as small and nimble and
"mashable" in normal applications.

Search is slowly permeating the [desktop][] as an assumption rather than
a feature. Microsoft has even taken the essence of a big iron EAI
toolset and scheduled it for inclusion as a [workflow engine][] suitable
for the desktop.

With these kinds of building blocks it's an exciting time to be an
application developer!
