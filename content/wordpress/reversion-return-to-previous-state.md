After a year of living in Brisbane, I'm returning to Melbourne and have
accepted a position at my old company, Atex.

I've learned a lot during my time in Brisbane. Lots of randomly useful
technical things, like the `explicit` keyword for C++ and how mobile
phones are built.

More importantly, I've discovered a lot of things about myself. A large
part why I'm going back is crystallization of my values and how they
impact what I do with my time.

If only I had managed the same revelations without the hassle of moving
interstate twice.

To keep things interesting I'm traveling around a bit:

-   3 - 10 Feb: In Melbourne conducting a training course for Trolltech
-   12, 13 Feb: Last days in the Brisbane office
-   14 Feb: Moving company takes my stuff
-   15 Feb: Attempt to clean enough to recover bond and then hit the
    road
-   16 Feb: Brief stop in Sydney
-   17 Feb: Drive to Melbourne
-   19 Feb: Commence work at Atex

I'll be a bit out of touch while moving gets sorted out. If you need to
get hold of me, my mobile is the best bet.
