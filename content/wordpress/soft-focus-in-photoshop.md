[Photoshop TV][]'s Matt Kloskowski highlighted a great tip for soft
focus, based on a sharpening technique.

Basic idea looks like:

1.  Create a copy into a new layer
2.  Apply the High Pass filter (use more radius than usual for
    sharpening)
3.  *Inverse the layer*
4.  Set the blend mode to Soft Light
5.  Adjust the layer opacity to taste

Without step 3, the photo is sharpened. With step 3, you get a lovely
soft focus effect. The advantage to this approach is the effect can be
selectively removed by painting on the layer with 50% grey.

This was an *a ha!* moment for me. I use high pass filter sharpening,
but it simply never occurred that it would also work for soft focus.

After a year or two of watching Photoshop User TV, I'm still learning
heaps. [Thanks guys!][]
