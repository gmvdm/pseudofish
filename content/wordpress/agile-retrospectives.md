Presentation from the authors of the book "[Agile Retrospectives][] -
Making Good Teams Great" at Google. Lots of great tips on how to improve
your sprint & project retrospectives.

One tip I picked up on was to ask "how was the energy for this sprint?"
rather than the bland "how are you feeling?".

Their structure for a retrospective is:

-   Set the Stage
-   Gather Data
-   Generate Insights
-   Decide What to Do
-   Close the Retrospective

The way to succeed with a process such as agile is through continuous
improvement. The forum for reviewing what needs to be improved and to
decide on how to improve things is the sprint retrospectives.

Retrospectives are critical for having a successful project.
