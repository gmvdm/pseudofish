Rumour is that search as we know it only solves 5% of the problem.

Pondering that means when I fail to find something, it has my attention.
The specific query, that sparked this post, is practically impossible
using Google.

    Find all places in Melbourne that have tennis courts,
    with lights are available for hire on Tuesday nights
    and include hire cost per hour.

    Order the results by descending distance from home

Can't be that hard, surely.
