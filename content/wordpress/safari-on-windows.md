[Safari][] has been available on Windows for a while. This provides
Apple with a wider development platform for iPhone apps. It also gives
Windows one of the fastest browsers around.

</p>

The 3.0.4 beta release adds a few new features that improve its
usability:

</p>

-   Ctrl-num keys now work. For example, Ctrl-1 launches the first URL
    in your bookmarks toolbar. (I love this feature)
    </p>
    <p>
-   Improved stability
-   Improved compatibility
-   Spell checking
-   and [heaps][] of others...

</p>

The other nice feature is *proper* font rendering.

</p>

I find that I still use Firefox for lots of development, but have
started to use Safari more as my main browser on Windows. It is simply
faster and more pleasant.
