Business and technology news is awash with the latest rounds of M&A.

Amidst the noise, Fred Wilson adds some [perspective][]:

Fred sees this from both sides, as a VC looking for liquidity and as a
consumer of web services looking for quality.

</p>

The problem with consolidation is in how large companies typically
innovate. To get a new idea through requires either skunkworks,
acquisition or sixteen layers of approval to risk people's time. It
becomes a problem of permission.

</p>

On the flip side, for a start-up you have two options: innovate or die.

</p>

Large companies are trying. Google's 1 day a week program gives explicit
permission for people to tinker. Microsoft invests big dollars in R&D
and the start-up community. Unfortunately, it isn't enough.

</p>

Fred is quite right. There needs to be a better path to liquidity. Or
stated differently, start-ups need a way to become companies, not food
for dinosaurs.
