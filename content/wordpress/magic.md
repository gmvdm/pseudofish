One of my favorite quotes!

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
>
> *Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of The Future", 1961 (Clarke's third law)*

On a recent trip to Germany, opened my dictionary from high school and
found prose that I recorded:

> The kernel of all jealousy is a lack of love
>
> *- C. Jung*

And:

> Courage, love, friendship,
>
> Compassion, and empathy
>
> Lift us above the simple beasts
>
> And define humanity.
>
> *- The Book of Counted Sorrows*

And one more discovered recently:

> Beauty must be constantly recreated as truth
>
> *- jean-christophe ammann*
