Summary: Research from J. Richard Hackman on the design of work teams helps inform the why behind much of agile.

Modern work is all about teams. They are at the core of agile
development.

To help better understand how design effective work teams, it is worth reading
through J. Richard Hackman's 1987 research paper:
[The design of work teams](http://groupbrain.wjh.harvard.edu/jrh/pub/JRH1987_1.pdf).

The paper is dense reading, so I extracted some relevant sections for future
reference.

## Background research

From the summary of earlier research, I found this interesting:

> In sum, research findings regarding process interventions suggest that
> structured techniques that minimize process losses (or reduce their effects)
> can be helpful. On the other hand, interventions that attempt to improve the
> quality of interpersonal relations among members to promote synergistic
> "process gains" appear not to yield reliable improvements in group task
> effectiveness.

That is, there is more improvements to gain from the lean approach to reducing
waste, and less from the common soft approaches to improving team
interactions.

## A Normative Model of Group Effectiveness

The goal of the paper is to create a model of group effectiveness, based on
research, such that:

1. The variables used in the model make non-trivial difference to group
performance
2. It is feasible to change them in an organization
3. People can understand and use them.

To be effective, the model is restricted to work groups in
organizations. Fortunately, this is the circumstances most of us find
ourselves in.

Hackman goes on to propose that the overall effectiveness of work groups in
organizations is a joint function of:

* The level of _effort_ group members collectively expend carrying out task
work,
* The amount of _knowledge and skill_ members bring to bear on the group task,
  and
* The appropriateness to the task of the _performance strategies_ used by the
  group in its work.

These are the hurdles a group must surmount to be effective, however don't
provide clear ways of modifying group behaviour. Instead, he goes on to
examine the impact of the following classes of variables:

* The _design of the group_ as a performing unit: the structure of the group
  task, the composition of the group, and the group norms that regulate member
  behaviour
* The _organizational context_ of the group: the reward, education, and
  information systems that influence the group, and the material resources
  that are put at the group's disposal
* _Group synergy_ resulting from members' interactions as they carry out the
  task

### Conditions that support effort

To expect a group to work hard on the group task, the following should be met:

* The group task requires members to use a variety of relatively _high-level
  skills_.
* The group task is a _whole and meaningful_ piece of work, with a _visible
  outcome_.
* The outcomes of the group's work on the task have _significant consequences_
  for other people (eg. other organisation members or external clients)
* The task provides group members with _substantial autonomy_ for deciding about
  hwo they do the work -- in effect, the group "owns" the task and is
  responsible for the work outcomes.
* Work on the task generates _regular, trustworthy feedback_ about how well the
  group is performing.

If a group task meets these criteria, it is likely that members will
experience their work as meaningful and feel collectively
responsible. Improving the design of a group's work is usually a better way to
foster high collective effort than directly addressing group norms about
productivity.

### Organisational context

Providing a supportive environment for teams becomes the key responsibility of
an organisation.

Reward systems that support high effort by teams tend to have the following
three features:

* Challenging, specific performance objectives
* Positive consequences for excellent performance
* Rewards and objectives that focus on group, not individual, behaviour

The destructive effects of rewarding individual rather than team performance
can be considerable.

### Group synergy

Group synergy can contribute in two ways, either by avoiding process losses or
by finding ways to create new internal resources that can be used in their
work -- capabilities that did not exist before the group created them.

It is not clear that building a great "spirit" in the team is sustainable or
if that commitment is sustainable if performance conditions remain poor.

Some other considerations:

* Minimise inappropriate weighting of member contributions
* Foster collective learning

### Design of the group

A group's composition is the most important condition. Well-composed groups
have the following characteristics:

* Individual members have high task-relevant expertise
* The group is large enough to do the work (but no bigger)
* Members have interpersonal as well as task skills
* Membership is moderately diverse (enough diversity to cover needed talent,
  yet similar enough to allow understanding and co-ordination)

## Task appropriate performance

To support a task appropriate performance strategy, some other factors to
consider:

* Design of the group
    * Group norms support self-regulation
    * Group norms suport situational scanning and strategic planning
* Organisational context
    * Clarity about the parameters of the performance situation
    * Access to data about likely consequences of alternative strategies
* Group synergy
    * Minimizing slippage in strategy implementation (eg. get to value
      quickly)
    * Creating innovative strategic plans

Excellent group performance requires _both_ a good design for the team and a
supportive organisation. Group synergy then acts as an amplifier to tune the
impact of design and context.

## An Action Model for Improving Group Effectiveness

The normative model (above) helps understand what conditions should be
present. The next step is a theory of action as to how to create teams that
fit the model.

### Diagnosis of existing teams

The approach to diagnosis depends on the organisational structure,
particularly the distribution of authority, and the tasks assigned
to the team.

Most agile teams are self-managing work groups, where the team members
themselves are responsible for monitoring and managing their own processes as
well as executing on the task.

Their performance depends on the quality of team design, the organisational
context, _and_ on the competence of teh group in managing and executing its
work.

Some teams are self-designing, where management's role is limited to the
team's organisational context.

### Creating new teams

The short version is that you should create teams that rank high on each of
the variables in the model. There is much more detail in the article, broken
down into four stages:

1. Prework
2. Creating performance conditions
3. Forming and building the team
4. Providing on-going assistance

Once a group is functioning as a social system, it will largely control its
own destiny. Managers can assist the group by making it easy for members to
re-negotiate situations that impede performance, by ensuring members get
on-going assistance to operate as a team, and by helping the group learn from
its experiences.

## Management of teams

### On leadership

Most research has focused on what leaders do within groups, however in this
context, leadership has the most influence in how to frame the groups task,
structure the group, its context, and to help get the group up and running.

It is not required to have an explicit leader within the group, although this
may make sense if substantial co-ordination is required. This is something
that should arise from within the group rather than be decided in advance.

### On Creating Redundant Conditions

There are many ways for a group to be effective, and even more for it to be
ineffective. Thus, it is impossible to specify in detail specific behaviours
managers should adopt to help groups perform effectively.

Based on the model and research, the key to effective group management may be
to create redundant conditions that support good performance, leaving groups
room to develop and enact their own ways of operating within those conditions.

Group performance does not have clean, unitary causes. To help a group improve
its effectiveness involves doing whatever is possible to create multiple,
redundant conditions that together may nudge the group toward more competent
task behaviour and, eventually, better performance.

### On Managerial Authority

Given the increase in autonomy and empowerment of teams, this suggests that
management attention be re-directed towards improving organisational
conditions that foster and support effective group behaviour.

Managerial authority should also be used to establish and enforce standards of
group behaviour and acceptable performance. Being vague can be as bad to a
group as traditional hands-on supervision. To enable groups to use their
authority well, managers must not be afraid to exercise their own.

### On Knowing Some Things

This approach to managing effective teams may require unfamiliar and seemingly
awkard management behaviours. To manage teams well, one needs to know some
things, have some skills and have opportunities to practice.

Investment in training, mentoring and coaching of managagers will result in
those who are expert in creating work teams, developing them, and harvesting
the considerable contributions they have to make to organisational
effectiveness.
