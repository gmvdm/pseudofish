Apple is likely to continue support for their own products on at least
Tiger and Leopard. This makes the case for upgrading less compelling. So
far I've yet to see anything (aside from Time Machine) that I'm dying
for in Leopard.

However, if third party applications start to ship for Leopard only,
then each application is going add more weight to my desire to upgrade.
This is the brilliance of the ease of programming offered by Mac OS X.
Something that seems to get better with each and every release.

I'm hearing "Developers, Developers, Developers", however this time the
music is coming from Apple.

Not a good time to be stuck waiting for an API in Vista ...
