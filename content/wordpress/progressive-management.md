Recently, I've been learning some new skills and re-aquiring some old
ones. So I'm paying attention to the process involved in developing a
new skill. How I developed the ability to manage people is something I
haven't been able to figure out.

[Steve Pavlina][] posted a [great article][] on using progressive
training to learn:

This is something well understood within most physical activities.
Progression is something that I hear often when listening to
snowboarders talk. There is a clear path to improvement. Other things
I've learnt have a very clear progression: tennis, mathematics, software
development, etc.

What is the progression for "management"?

I've spent the last few years managing people in a few environments and
I think I've improved. But it isn't clear to me how to improve from
where I'm at. What is the next heaviest weight, the next big jump, the
next technique to learn?

Part of the problem is that I've never formally been taught to "manage".
It is a skill acquired through a combination of necessity and
circumstance. Not satisfied with that, I'm reading a large number of
[books][] on management and related skills.

There doesn't seem to be a *right* path. Instead, I now have a range of
views from different authors and mentors about the best ways to manage
under different circumstances.

Looking around at my peers, the people who reported to me and the people
I reported to, the quality of management didn't correlate with position
in the organisational chart. Rising up the rungs within a company
doesn't equate with a progression of the skill of management. Often
rising higher indicates other skills, such as project success, or sales,
or good timing.

So if you are in a position of management, what is it that you do to
increase your managerial skills? What is the heavy lifting to progress
to the next level?
