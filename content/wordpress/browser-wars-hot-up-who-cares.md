[Recent reports][] highlight Internet Explorer's drop in percentage of
internet users. Given the huge war between Mozilla and IE, it sounds
like big news, but is it?

</p>

These days I don't think browsers are as important. The innovation in
one is rapidly copied to another. The UI differences between Firefox,
IE, Safari and Chrome are minimal. Each of them does a good job of
rendering standards based HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Each vendor has a use for their browser. Microsoft has a component
version of IE it can embed in most of Windows. Apple has a component
version of Safari that it can use across Mac OS X and iPhone OS.
Google's browser is optimized to run Google's style of application.
Firefox is a great platform for building browsers, while also being a
browser.

</p>

The important thing today is to own a destination worth browsing to. And
that is a much harder challenge.
