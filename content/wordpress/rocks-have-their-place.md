> One day, a Tibetan Lama was speaking to a group of monks and, to make
> a point, pulled out a large jar, set it on the table in front of him,
> produced a few fist-sized rocks, and placed them into the jar.
>
> When no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, 'Is this jar full?'.
> Everyone said, 'Yes'. He reached under the table and pulled out a
> bucket of gravel, poured some in and shook the jar, the gravel worked
> between the rocks.
>
> Again he asked: 'Is this jar full?' The monks were catching on.
> 'Probably not,' one answered. 'Good!' he replied and reached under the
> table and brought out a bucket of sand. He dumped the sand into the
> jar until it filled all the crevices.
>
> Once more he asked: 'Is this jar full?' 'No!' the monks shouted.
> 'Good!' He said and grabbed a pitcher of water and poured until the
> jar was filled to the brim. Then asked, 'What is the point of this
> illustration?'
>
> One young monk responded, 'The point is, no matter how full your day
> you can always fit some more things in.' 'No,' the speaker replied,
> 'the point is that if you don't put the big rocks in first, you'll
> never get them all in at all. What are the priorities in your life?'
