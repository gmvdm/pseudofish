On January 21^st^, aged 89, Marie Smith died and with her the Eyak
language passed into oblivion.

From the [Economist][]:

> This universe of words and observations was already fading when Marie
> was young. In 1933 there were 38 Eyak-speakers left, and white people
> with their grim faces and intrusive microphones, as they always
> appeared to her, were already coming to sweep up the remnants of the
> language.
>
> As the spoken language died, so did the stories of tricky
> Creator-Raven and the magical loon, of giant animals and tiny
> homunculi with fish-spears no bigger than a matchstick. People forgot
> why “hat” was the same word as “hammer”, or why the word for a leaf,
> kultahl, was also the word for a feather, as though deciduous trees
> and birds shared one organic life.
>
> Most outsiders were told to buzz off. But one scholar, Michael Krauss
> of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, showed such love for Eyak,
> painstakingly recording its every suffix and prefix and glottal stop
> and nasalisation, that she worked happily with him to compile a
> grammar and a dictionary; and Elizabeth Kolbert of the *New Yorker*
> was allowed to talk when she brought fresh halibut as a tribute.
> Without those two visitors, almost nothing would have been known of
> her.
>
> ... in an age where perhaps half the planet's languages will disappear
> over the next century, killed by urban migration or the internet or
> the triumphal march of English, Eyak has no chance. For Mrs Smith,
> however, the death of Eyak meant the not-to-be-imagined disappearance
> of the world.
