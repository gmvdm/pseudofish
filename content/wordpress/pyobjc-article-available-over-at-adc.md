Apple has recently posted an [introduction to PyObjC][] over at ADC. The
article is courtesy of the [Red Shed][] and even includes movies of the
Interface Builder bits.

This is a sensational result for the PyObjC team for several reasons.
First up, there are likely to be more developers writing PyObjC
applications, which will result in an even larger community. Secondly,
and perhaps more importantly, the article provides an official looking
stamp for the community

My congratulations to all involved, both in terms of making PyObjC a
reality and in terms of producing a Ruby on Rails style piece of
marketing!
