After tracking down why a few apps broke on my new Tiger install, I was
starting to ponder the wisdom of formating my main drive as case
sensitive. Most things seem to work, but there are a fair few apps that
are breaking.

It then occurred to me that as a developer writing software for Mac OS X
I owed it to myself to be running on a case sensitive drive for testing
purposes. The pain I'm going through with other applications I will
never go through with my own apps.

For the few apps that are sufficiently broken to not be fixable by a bit
of file re-naming, it is a simple matter of isolating them in their own
case insensitive disk image.

Of course I should be able to have a separate partition that I can make
case insensitive, but with only 40Gb available I tend to run out of
space a lot and am not prepared to have to deal with multiple partitions
too.
