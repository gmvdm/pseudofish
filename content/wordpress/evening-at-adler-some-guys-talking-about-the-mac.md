After watching the [Evening at Adler][] video, I can safely say that it
is a must see for anyone developing software for the Apple platform. DB
managed to assemble the who's who of Mac software development for a
round table chat.

Inspirational and informative, with a touch of controversy and some
laugh out loud comedic moments. Can't go wrong really. Although I
suspect the background [music][] was chosen for the closing visuals.
