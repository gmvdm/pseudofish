Title: Learning Ruby on Rails

This year, my technology goal is to learn Ruby on Rails.

</p>

I often try to learn new programming languages, averaging around one a
year. Sometimes it is a matter of coming back to a language I haven't
used in a while, other times it is learning a new framework.

</p>

After using Ruby for some scripting last year, I decided that Rails was
a good choice to learn as a framework this year. Two things convinced
me.

</p>

Firstly, lots of web innovation appears to arise from the Ruby
community. [Cucumber][] is one that has particularly caught my interest.

</p>

Secondly is [Heroku][]. This is simply an awesome way to bootstrap a
project. No mess, no fuss, code - deploy - repeat. It means I can launch
an early version of the app with minimal investment of time or funding.

</p>

To dive in deep on a platform like Rails, I've taken a few steps:

</p>

-   **Books** – Admittedly still on order, I'm investing in some Rails
    books, as I find books provide broader coverage of topics than blogs
    alone.
-   **Blogs** – My RSS reader is being filled out with Ruby and Rails
    blogs. I subscribed to 20 odd to start with and will curate them
    over time.
-   **Podcasts** – The Rails community is served by a number of great
    podcasts and [screencasts][]. [Railscasts][screencasts] is a great
    entry point and I added others for broader coverage.
-   **Twitter** – Where I find bloggers or people that are influential
    in the Rails community, I add them to my Twitter [list][].
-   **Friends** – To start the process, I also asked a few friends who
    were Rails experts for suggestions of where to start. Pete put
    together quite a [good list][].
-   **Tools** – Installing Rails was a good start. I also added TextMate
    to my tool collection. There are some nice features that may cause
    me to make changes to my .vimrc one day.

</p>

All of that is the easy part. The next step is to actually write a bunch
of Rails code. So far I'm tinkering with example code. However, I do
have a larger project in mind which should provide the incentive to
carry through. Details on that are for a later date.

</p>

If there are sources of good Rails info that you can recommend, please
let me know either in comments, [Twitter][] or email.
