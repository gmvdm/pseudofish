Title: Thinking of Music

A few interesting, music related things I've been playing with recently
that I thought I'd share.

1.  [Pandora][] - Given a song, an artist, the site creates a stream of
    music that sounds like what you gave them. You can then adjust what
    each station delivers to you, based on you saying you like or
    dislike a particular track.

    Currently in invitation only preview mode, send them [an
    email][Pandora] and you might be lucky. It is a great way to
    discover new music. Downside is that it is based on a very good AJAX
    style web interface, which means getting it to play through my
    Airport Express isn't fun. But then it is a preview...

2.  [Cover Flow][] - Still in tech demo phase, but showing ridiculous
    amounts of promise, a visual browser for albums. Integrated into
    iTunes and a host of web sites so most of the cover art turns up,
    with drag and drop for those that don't.

    Gives back the feel of flicking through your albums, which is
    something I missed when I was at a loss as to what I feel like
    listening to.

    Only for Mac OS X 10.4 at the moment

3.  [Delicious Library][] - Somewhat over-hyped recently, this is still
    a really good start at a product. Provides a digital track record of
    your physical assets (CDs, Books, Movies, Games) and the ability to
    remember who has borrowed what.

    I'll be more sold on this when I can see what is in the library of
    my friends. It is more interesting to know what I can borrow from
    others as I already know what I have (or had, given how good I am at
    tracking borrowers). To that end, the export functionality is
    somewhat lacking.

4.  [MPC][] (& [MpcOSX][]) - Music Player Daemon. Server side music
    player with a host of clients. Incredibly useful if you want to set
    up a server somewhere with all of your music that can be controlled
    from just about any type of client.

    The existing clients are still a bit alpha in terms of feel, but the
    idea is solid.

    See [linux.ars][] for a bigger write up (towards end of post).
