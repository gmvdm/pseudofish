[Hugh][] has gone back to incredibly interesting with his recent move to
Microsoft. Over the last few months, his blog hasn't been as interesting
as it was in the days of his innovation with [Stormhoek][] and [English
Cut][]. Check out his [commentary][] on Open Source and Microsoft.

[Guy][] has lost my attention very quickly, and is running the risk of
being unsubscribed. The signal to noise ratio is not looking good, as
his blog now feels like it is more about him than his audience. A sad
change from what was once a great source of information.

[Seth][] continues to be brilliant. Constant stream of insight on many
topics. Check out the blog for his new book, [the Dip][].

[Trizle][] has rapidly risen in grabbing my attention. Daily insights
into all aspects of entrepreneurship, with [Kathy Sierra][] style fun.
