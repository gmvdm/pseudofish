[PyObjC][] has been officially released for Tiger. This is a big
upgrade, and includes wrappers for some of the new Tiger technologies,
better py2app support and a heap of bug fixes.

So if you weren't happy following the dev release using subversion, you
now have no excuses. Oh yeah, and it will still work on 10.3, with some
testing done for 10.2 (if you are still using 10.2 and have issues,
please use the mailing list to let the developers know of any issues).

I also found a nice [article][] if you want to start right from the
beginning of almost no development knowledge at all for creating Python
based Objective C applications. Assumes no knowledge of XCode or
Interface Builder (IB) or python for that matter.

For something more interesting, [xml.com][] have a very good article,
[Unicode Secrets][] by Uche Ogbuji, which explains how to use unicode
properly in Python. Essential reading if you have even vague thoughts of
ever using XML in an application.
