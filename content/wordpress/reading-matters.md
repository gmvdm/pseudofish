An interesting [article][] in the NYTimes on reading habits of CEOs:

> Serious leaders who are serious readers build personal libraries
> dedicated to how to think, not how to compete.
>
> Perhaps that is why — more than their sex lives or bank accounts —
> chief executives keep their libraries private.

I'm in the midst of choosing some new bookcases. My [book collection][]
is starting to get out of hand. A good problem to have methinks.

Thanks to [Brad][] for the link, and for a number of great book
recommendations from his blog.
