The [history of Haskell][] has recently been published. It is a rather
long read (55 pages), but a rewarding one. It covers how Haskell formed,
decisions around why language constructs were introduced and surveys
where it is at today.

Haskell was the second functional programming language I learnt.
Miranda, my first, was the language used for first year programming at
Melbourne Uni. Reading back on how Haskell split and evolved from
Miranda filling in a lot of gaps for me.

There is also discussion on how Haskell has matured, stats on community
growth, and case studies of commercial use. There is even a glimpse of
the future:

> One day, Haskell will be no more than a distant memory. But we believe
> that, when that day comes, the ideas and techniques that it nurtured
> will prove to have been of enduring value through their influence on
> languages of the future.
