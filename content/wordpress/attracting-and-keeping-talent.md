[John Hagel][] has a brilliant summary of [talent acquisition][] and how
to avoid talent drain.

> ... we are seeing a new rationale for the firm emerge â€“ firms exist to
> accelerate talent development. This is increasingly the reason why
> people choose to affiliate with firms.

> The winners in the global economy will be the firms that can find ways
> to break this vicious cycle and harness network effects for talent
> development both within and across firms.

Some of the areas covered include:

1.  Attract and retain vs. develop.
2.  Training vs. learning.
3.  Attract and retain vs. access and motivate.
4.  Automation vs. amplification.
5.  Strategic importance of growth.

I highly recommend reading the whole [article][talent acquisition]. John
doesn't post often, and when he does it is something insightful - well
worth adding the [RSS feed][].
