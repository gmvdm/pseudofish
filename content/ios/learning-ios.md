Summary: Some notes from learning about iOS programming

I am attempting to get into
[beginner's mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) as I dive into
learning iOS programming.

This post includes some of the resources that I've found useful so far.

## Books
* [iOS Programming](http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Guides-ebook/dp/B007OWBAB0/ref=nosim/pseudofish-20)
  -- start here. This is _the_ book to get you going with iOS programming. The
  remaining resources aren't helpful without understanding the fundamentals.
* [Test-Driven iOS Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Developers-Library-ebook/dp/B007RNK0W6/ref=nosim/pseudofish-20)
  -- my next book to read.
* [The Core iOS 6 Developer's Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Developers-Cookbook-Edition-Library-ebook/dp/B00AFXID2E/ref=nosim/pseudofish-20).
  -- yet to read, with code samples [online](https://github.com/erica/iOS-6-Cookbook).
* [The Advanced iOS 6 Developer's Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Developers-Cookbook-Edition-ebook/dp/B00BMQOGLU/ref=nosim/pseudofish-20)
  -- yet to read, with code samples [online](https://github.com/erica/iOS-6-Advanced-Cookbook).

I'm now fully sold on tech books on Kindle, as I can read on multiple devices
and have available on my Mac for searching when needed.

## Blogs
* [objc.io](http://www.objc.io/) -- advanced topics, in magazine/RSS format.
* [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com) -- deep dives on a range of topics.
* [Cocoa with Love](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/) -- lots of great content in
  the archives.
* [NSScreencasts](http://nsscreencast.com) -- some free and some subscription screencasts.

## Podcasts
* [iPhreaks](http://iphreaksshow.com/) -- great introductary podcast. Their
  [first episode](http://iphreaksshow.com/getting-started-with-ios-development/)
  includes lots of things to get going.
* [NSBrief](http://nsbrief.com/) -- in depth on a range of topics with
  guests. A mix of iOS & Mac themes.
* [Identical Cousins](http://identicalcousins.net/) -- general chat on a range
  of topics.
* [Edge Cases](http://edgecasesshow.com/) -- two iOS experts chatting. What's
  not to like.



## Other tactics

I am making a point of trying to read as much iOS code as I can. I find this
helpful in seeing how other programmers have solved problems. I'm using a mix
of [production](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios) and example
code, as well as examining particular commits that look interesting.

I am attempting to fill my Twitter feed with useful iOS content, and randomly
following people relating to iOS programming. (eg.
@[mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt),
@[drance](https://twitter.com/drance),
@[chockenberry](https://twitter.com/chockenberry),
@[mattjgalloway](https://twitter.com/mattjgalloway),
@[rwenderlich](https://twitter.com/rwenderlich), &
@[secboffin](https://twitter.com/secboffin))

The other thing I'm doing is to have a hobby iOS project. This gives me
specific challenges to try and solve in a real app. So far, I have this
deployable through [TestFlight](https://testflightapp.com/) to try out on a
few phones around the house.

Still so much to dig into and learn. I'm not yet comfortable with unit
testing for iOS, and this is the next big thing on my list. Things like
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/),
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking),
[mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator), and
[Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) are likely to follow.
