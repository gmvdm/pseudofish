Thanks to [Brad][] I'm addicted to Barry Eisler's books. The main
protagonist, John Rain, is like Jack Bauer from 24 except with a license
to kill and operating outside the law.

Actually, Jack does that anyway. The main differences are that John is
half Japanese, has good taste in scotch and listens to jazz. Throughout
the series several jazz CDs are mentioned - as part of the plot or in an
appendix.

I'm posting the lists for future reference, so I can pass the books on.

### Live Jazz CDs

(mentioned by John Rain in Rain Storm)

1.  Lynne Arriale - Live at Montreax
2.  Eva Cassidy - Live at Blues Ally
3.  Bill Evans Trio - Sunday at the Village Vanguard

### Rain's Top Ten Jazz CDs You Might Not Have Heard Of

(comments by Barry Eisler in Killing Rain)

1.  **Eric Alexander** - Young tenor saxophonist with a ton of heart.
    Start with *Nightlife in Tokyo*, of course ... Nothing fancy, just
    terrific jazz.
2.  **Monica Borrfors** - Swedish vocalist I first heard in Bar Satoh in
    Osaka, the world's best whiskey bar. *Slowfox* is a collection of
    songs in English, all rendered in Borrfors' warm, slightly husky,
    beautiful voice.
3.  **Charles Brown** - Brown's voice contains pain and hope and the
    wisdom of experience, and his piano is top notch too.
4.  **Akiko Grace** - Bill Evans, Thelonious Monk ... Akiko Grace. Her
    piano is that good. Love and loss and hope and elegy -- I don't know
    how someone so young can understand and express it all, but Japanese
    composer/pianist Grace does.
5.  **Patricia Kaas** - French vocalist with a wonderfully alluring
    voice ... try *Tour De Charme*, which contains two tracks in
    English, the rest in French.
6.  **Marisa Monte** - Brazilian pop? Jazz? Choro? Who cares? Monte's
    voice is so enchanting that it doesn't matter if you can't
    understand the Portuguese lyrics. Start with *Rose & Charcoal*.
7.  **Junko Onishi** - Japanese pianist I first saw in Club Alfie in
    Tokyo, where she provided the inspiration for the character who
    became Midori Kawamura. Plays like an angry Thelonious Monk, as
    Alfie's Mama-san might put it ...
8.  **Brenda Russell** - Russell is hard to classify -- jazz, light
    jazz, R&B, soul ...? Her voice is a caress -- she can lull you to
    laugh, to sleep, to tears.
9.  **Luciana Souza** - Is it jazz or choro? Who cares? Souza's vocals
    are a delight. Listen to the voice and you'll fall in love with the
    woman.
10. **Toku** - Japanese flugelhorn player and vocalist with an assured
    baritone voice, and a terrific performer -- at the Tokyo live
    houses, Toku packs 'em in.

ps. I've managed to draw the series out by limiting myself to one per
Amazon purchase, otherwise I'd be finished by now :)
