If you are a developer, a product owner, or manage a development team,
much of the input is going to be about product design. It is very useful
to understand a bit about a good design process, so you can better ask
questions and help refine the design based on technical constraints.

</p>

[About Face][], by Alan Cooper, is a great book to start with.

</p>

I highlighted much of it on my Kindle!

</p>

Here are some quotes:

</p>

<p>
> Good design makes users more effective.

</p>

<p>
> Customers, although they might be able to articulate the problems with
> an interaction, are not often capable of visualizing the solutions to
> those problems.

</p>

<p>
> One of the most powerful tools designers bring to the table is empathy
>
> </p>
>
> One of the most dangerous practices in product development is
> isolating designers from the users because doing so eliminates
> empathic knowledge.
>
> </p>
> <p>

</p>

<p>
> narrative is also one of our most powerful creative methods.

</p>

<p>
> What would a helpful human do? What would a thoughtful, considerate
> interaction feel like?

</p>

All ideas are broken down into discrete sections, with lots of detail
and examples on how to implement this with your customers.

</p>

<p>
> </p>
>
> Goal-Directed Design combines techniques of ethnography, stakeholder
> interviews, market research, detailed user models, scenario-based
> design, and a core set of interaction principles and patterns.
>
> </p>
>
> This process can be roughly divided into six phases: Research,
> Modeling, Requirements Definition, Framework Definition, Refinement,
> and Support

</p>

The book discusses the mindset required to be a good designer:

</p>

<p>
> </p>
>
> in anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is
> no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to
> take away
>
> </p>
>
> Next time you find yourself crowing about what cool interaction you've
> designed, just remember that the ultimate user interface for most
> purposes is no interface at all.

</p>

The first part of the book focuses on processes to elicit a good design.
The latter part of the book covers specific examples found in user
interface design and attempts to encode common patterns.

</p>

I found the first section much more valuable to how I think about
designing a new product. The latter parts I felt were obvious, although
that is perhaps their importance.

</p>

Well worth a read.

*Note*: Bret's [Magic Ink][] is a useful counterpoint to About Face.
