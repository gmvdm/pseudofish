Joel Spolsky has an interesting [article][] about the difficulty of
identifying an exceptional programmer if they are using Java.

To quote:

> The recruiters-who-use-grep, by the way, are ridiculed here, and for
> good reason. I have never met anyone who can do Scheme, Haskell, and C
> pointers who can't pick up Java in two days, and create better Java
> code than people with five years of experience in Java, but try
> explaining that to the average HR drone.
