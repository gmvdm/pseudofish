Estimating software development is hard. But it doesn't have to be
impossible.

[Software Estimation][] by Steve McConnell draws together research and
experience from the field of estimation into a single, easy to read,
volume.

The biggest lesson I got out of the book is "Count, Compute, Judge".

> *Count* if at all possible. *Compute* when you can't count. Use
> *judgement* alone only as a last resort.

The software estimation I have been involved in falls into the realm of
*judgement*. This is usually due to insufficient data available, or the
lack of knowledge of the data that needs to be collected.

Some other highlights include:

-   Relevant information from many sources (ie. key formulas from
    research papers, process details and examples)

-   Details of industry studies and references to other work, allowing
    for deeper study.

-   Broad coverage of estimation topics. There is much happening in this
    area, and this book covers it from a practical standpoint.

-   Strategies for presenting estimates to stakeholders and navigating
    the associated political minefield.

    > ... estimate negotiations tend to be between introverted technical
    > staff (developers) and seasoned professional negotiators (sales
    > staff).

One area I found missing from the book is estimating changes to existing
systems, such as maintenance and enhancements. The focus for the book is
on new features and creating new products. Hopefully the process and
systems recommended, such as estimating from historical data, covers
maintenance development.

In addition to good process and practice, there is a useful section
towards the end with rules of thumb derived from industry findings. Some
of them include:

-   To go from one-company, one-campus development to international
    outsource development, allow for a 40% increase in effort.

-   Allow for a 1% to 4% increase in requirements per month.

-   For first-time development with new language and tools compared to
    comparable development with familiar language and tools, allow for a
    20% to 40% increase in effort.

-   For administrative and clerical support, add 5% to 10% to the base
    effort estimate.

Software estimation is an important part of the development process.
Estimates provide the benchmark that subsequent development is measured
against. Making estimation an area that deserves more study, and making
this book a must read for any software professional.
