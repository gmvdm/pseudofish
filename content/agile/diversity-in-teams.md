From "Multicultural teams meta-analysis":

> the literature also clearly shows that multi-national teams have the
> potential to be more creative than intra-national teams, thanks to the varying
> perspectives that individuals from different countries bring to the team



> We propose that task complexity will augment the effect of cultural
> diversity. If the task is complex, the opportunities for process gains
> through divergence (e.g., enhanced creativity) will be greater. However,
> aligning through positive convergence processes will be more difficult, and
> the opportunities for conflict will also be greater.

Select results from the study:

- cultural diversity is positively associated with creativity
- cultural diversity is associated with higher, not lower, levels of
  satisfaction
- cultural diversity has a negative influence on the affective dimension of
  social integration assessed in this study

> Collectively, the main effect analyses suggest that cultural diversity
> increases task conflict and reduces social integration among team
> members. These process losses may be offset by process gains in the form of
> enhanced creativity and, counter to our hypothesis, satisfaction with the
> team process.

Digging into some of the specifics:

> Cultural diversity is positively asso- ciated with conflict when task
> complexity is high, and unrelated to conflict when task complexity is low.


> The results of subgroup analyses suggest that team size moderates the
> effects of cultural diversity on communication effectiveness and
> satisfaction. As the team size increases, cultural diversity is associated
> with reduced communication effectiveness and satisfaction

> the results suggest that cultural diversity is associated with higher levels
> of conflict and less effective communication in teams that have spent more
> time together compared with teams with less tenure. No evidence of
> moderating effects were found for satisfaction and social integration.


Overall:

> The overall findings confirmed that cultural diversity was unrelated
> directly to team performance.
