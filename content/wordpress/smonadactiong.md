[Autrijus][] gave a wonderful [talk][] on [Haskell][] at OSDC. One
insight that must be shared:

> Everywhere you see Monad, replace it with Action in your head.

Monads are conceptually quite tricky. This simple insight is an "ahha!"
moment. Several years of studying (and teaching) Haskell at Uni and this
clarified the concept like no other tutorial.
