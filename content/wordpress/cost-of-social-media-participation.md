Social media is the latest buzz phrase to describe the trend in *normal*
people creating content. Something previously the realm of professional
journalists.

In a [recent article][], Nina Simon investigates how much time is
involved per week for different types of participation:

I'm considered fairly involved as I participate in a number of services,
including this blog, Flickr, Twitter, Facebook and monitor a forum here
or there. Some of my friends are participating with Twitter alone, as
Twitter dropped the barrier of entry to virtually nil.

</p>

This raised a question of how journalists are allocated time for social
media. The trend in traditional media is to attempt to integrate social
media into the news process. This includes using user generated content
in the print product and on the web. But it also involves journalists
becoming members of the community.

</p>

The obvious implication is that more time is required. However, with
newsrooms shrinking and with print and online operations attempting to
converge, available time is reduced.

Until time is allocated to social media, the voice of the traditional
media will continue to broadcast rather than participate in the
conversation.
