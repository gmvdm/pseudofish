-   On the flight, I get to watch lectures on iPhone development from
    [Stanford][], along with talks from a [conference][] in California.
-   Catch up with family and friends in Singapore, as a result of
    sharing my location on Facebook.
-   Photos I took of [Singapore][] are instantly shared with other
    friends and family around the world.
-   I keep in touch with my girlfriend back home using free telephony
    via the internet (thanks Skype).
-   A friend at work recommends a book to me, and I order it from
    America to arrive at my Melbourne office, along with some other
    recommended books to read.
-   Reviews, freely published on the internet, guide me through a tricky
    lens purchase. Global warranty allows me to haggle in Singapore's
    Chinatown for a lower price than back home.
-   Hear about a new album by [Fat Freddy's Drop][], a New Zealand band,
    on Twitter on my phone, purchase the album and instantly(ish)
    download via wireless internet
-   My camera (5D2) gets updated with new features today, via the
    internet, making it more video capable.
-   Subscriptions via [NetNewsWire][] and [Tweetie][] on the iPhone
    guide me through the bankruptcy intricacies as two 20th Century car
    companies fall apart.
-   I can share this with you, as publishing is freely available.

Thinking back only a few decades, most of this would seem science
fiction. I'm looking forward to the next few!

ps. I still hold out hope for personal flying devices in my lifetime.
