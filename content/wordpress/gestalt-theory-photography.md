Basically, a bunch of psychologists spent lots of research to figure out
how we view images and derive meaning from them.

</p>

Turns out, this research is very useful for thinking about photography.
Jeff Curto put together two podcasts explaining the connections:

-   Go With the Gestalt ([part 1][], [part 2][])

The four main visual ideas to add meaning to your photos are:

</p>

-   Closure
-   Continuance
-   Similarity
-   Proximity

Reading the [wikipedia article][Wikipedia] with a view to photographic
composition can help open up some visual opportunities. [Jeff's
podcast][] is very useful for thinking about the creative side of
photography.
