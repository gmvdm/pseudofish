My current reading list is mixed between coding, decision making, agile,
and strategy. Richard Rumelt's [Good Strategy Bad Strategy][] stands out
as an interesting and entertaining read.

I liked how he outlined good strategy, and also how to identify bad
strategy. This really helps in pushing through from a good enough
attempt to a strategy that will make a difference.

Some quotes:

> Good strategy almost always looks this simple and obvious and does not
> take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain. It does not pop out
> of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or
> fill-in-the-blanks scheme. Instead, a talented leader identifies the
> one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can
> multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates
> action and resources on them.

> Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a
> wide variety of actions and interests. Strategy is at least as much
> about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does.

On identifying bad strategy:

> I have condensed my list of its key hallmarks to the four listed in
> the beginning of this chapter: fluff, the failure to face the
> challenge, mistaking goals for strategy, and bad strategic objectives.

On the structure of a good strategy:

> The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a
> guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy specifies the
> approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It
> is like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the
> details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible coordinated
> policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the
> guiding policy.

> The problem of coming up with a good strategy has the same logical
> structure as the problem of coming up with a good scientific
> hypothesis. The key differences are that most scientific knowledge is
> broadly shared, whereas you are working with accumulated wisdom about
> your business and your industry that is unlike anyone else’s. A good
> strategy is, in the end, a hypothesis about what will work.

The book provides insight into the structure of a good strategy.
However, it stops short of providing actionable techniques or analysis
to help you get there. In this, it advocates strategy work being done by
someone with a deep understanding of the business and competitive
landscape.

This left me wanting more, and fortunately there are books out there
that provide guidelines on this type of analysis. I see a few [Michael
Porter][] books in my future reading.
