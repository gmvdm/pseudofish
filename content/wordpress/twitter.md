I admit, I didn't understand [Twitter][] when it first came out. I still
wasn't sold on the second wave of popularity. In fact, the blogosphere
never sold me on Twitter. So why am I now using it regularly?

</p>

Local.

</p>

It needed to be local for me. Once a few of the developers in my office
started using it, I payed more attention to my own account. Now it's
more addictive than Facebook. Although for similar reasons.

</p>

The difference is that you can follow someone on Twitter without needing
to establish friendship. Thus I can quote one of my heros:

</p>

</p>

The UDP/TCP distinction completely nails it for me. Twitter is all about
broadcast. Chat is better for exactly that, chatting.

</p>

The whole status thing has been done before, the status message in MSN,
the status in Facebook. The catch is that they are all walled gardens
and require a two way relationship to be established.

</p>

The benefit of a low barrier to subscription to broadcast is that anyone
can follow updates. This means that you hear things on Twitter before
they get anywhere else.

</p>

It feels more dynamic.

</p>

It is the backchannel for the internet.

</p>

I'm [sold][].
