Apple's [iPod Shuffle][] is now only $65 AUD ($49 USD). I picked up one
when they cost a bit more, and found it to be a very useful way of
playing music when I didn't want to have to think about it. Like when
snowboarding.

The downside? It so small and convenient, I can't seem to find mine.
Perhaps this is a good reason (excuse) to look at an iPod Touch.
