Intelligence

Paradigms

[The art of looking sideways][] is [Alan][] [Fletcher][]'s ode to
design, creativity, life and everything in between. Loosely arranged in
72 chapters, I'm only partially through the book as it is quite dense in
information. This is a book that I find myself dipping into for
inspiration. A book that is likely to be close to hand for as long as I
can read.
