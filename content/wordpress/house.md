For a bit of a change in obsessions, I've been watching a lot of the tv
series [House][], partially to recover from snowboarding, and partially
to turn my brain off by watching others learn and solve problems.

Classic quote:

> House: "You're British"
>
> Chase: "I'm Australian"
>
> House: "You put the Queen on your money. You're British"
