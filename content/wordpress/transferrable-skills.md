Title: Transferrable Skills

After a bit of travel and consulting for my new company, I am reflecting
on the skills that I have learnt that transferred and those that did
not.

My knowledge of my former company's products, for obvious reasons, is
almost completely useless in my new job. However, the ability to acquire
that knowledge - something I was expected to do rapidly at Atex - has
proven invaluable. This has led to me having a very good understanding
of Qtopia in a very short space of time.

The experience I gained in terms of interacting with customers as a
vendor and also from communicating (dare I say selling?) our company's
offering has also been very useful. This recent trip saw me dropped into
deep water, and it was disappointing to float without learning any new
skills.

Some new challenges are definitely required - rumours of project
management may help.

winter, drizzle and overcast, with an added bonus of more daylight hours
to enjoy it</small>
