Melbourne's inaugural [blogging meet-up][] came together tonight with a
very strong turnout.

I usually avoid social gatherings such as this, but the celebrity draw
of [Darren][] as the organizer made it hard to miss. I'm really glad
that I went, and I'd encourage attendance at the next one.

The interesting thing for me was to talk to people within areas of the
blog world I have nothing to do with. The opportunities are quite
varied, and I tend to get caught up in the few niches that I follow
(tech, business, photography).

A few example discussions may help:

-   [Fashionising][] - really a social network site for the fashion
    industry, there is also a [blog][] component to the site. A small
    team, they are more entrepreneurs than bloggers, and quite a
    surprise. Expect to hear more from these guys.

-   [The Tomato blog][] - Ed tells [the story][] on his site. Short
    version is a failed magazine, written by a [freelance journalist][],
    about food, sparks a [successful blog][].

-   [SmallOfficeAustralia][] - just in its infancy, [Martin][] is
    creating an online destination for local small business. He has lots
    of ideas on how to serve this market, and it will be interesting to
    watch over the next year. Especially given that [local][] is the new
    [big][].

Well worth the time spent, and a great venue at [Horse Bazaar][].

Thanks again to [Darren][] for organizing, and thank you to all the
wonderful people I met.
