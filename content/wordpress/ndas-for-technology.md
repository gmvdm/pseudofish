One of the big hassles in my job has been attempting to organize NDA
agreements with customers and partners. The fun and games begin with
multi-party NDA agreements.

</p>

The VC community has solved the problem by avoiding NDAs where ever
possible, as outlined on [Ask the VC][] and by [Rick Segal][] on his
blog.

</p>

To my mind, the act of non-disclosure is a question of trust. If you
really need to rely on NDAs then the relationship between the parties
should be questioned. Maybe it is more like patents, you file them in
the hope you never have to use them ... but just in case.

<u>Bonus Link:</u> [Brad][] has an [article][] from last year on NDA's
too.
