Paul has an [interesting article][] about describing languages:

I'd like to add to his list:

</p>

-   [Haskell][]: Lisp doesn't have types
-   [Mercury][]: Prolog doesn't have types and requires too much
    knowledge of the internals

</p>

There should be a nice concise summary of Objective-C, but as I've been
avoiding it I've struggled to come up with one. It doesn't solve the
problem of C being too low level. The closest I could get was that it
added Object Oriented programming concepts to C.
