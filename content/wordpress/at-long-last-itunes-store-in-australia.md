The perfect iPod accessory, legally downloadable music!

I've bought my first song (Ben Lee - Catch My Disease) and am very
happy. Click and it all magically happens, based on my existing Apple
billing details. All too simple really.

We don't seem to have won TV shows yet, but Pixar shorts are up and a
wide range of music. The downside is that I can see my iTunes account
rivaling my Amazon account for purchases ;)
