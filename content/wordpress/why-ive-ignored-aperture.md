Title: Why I've Ignored Aperture

One word: [Lightroom][]

I've been using a bunch of [DAM][] software over the years, but had
settled on a mixture of iView Media Pro and Photoshop to fulfil my
digital darkroom needs. As I've progressed to outputting substantially
more photos recently, I wanted something that would allow me to rapidly
process files, handle my DAM needs and also run cross platform.

The two things that killed Aperture for me, rapid and cross platform. My
recent investments have gone into lenses and lighting equipment, so am
still using my trusty old 12" PowerBook. Not a hope in hell of Aperture
running on that, let alone nicely. I travel for work, and am obliged to
take my work laptop - a Dell. Again, no dice for Aperture.

My experiences with Lightroom have been largely positive. I'm still
shooting mostly Jpgs, and Lightroom will process them using the same
controls used for Raw files. It will happily run on all the hardware I
own, and is allowing me to stay on Photoshop CS, as I can use Lightroom
for Raw processing and then edit DNG files in Photoshop. The main reason
I had for upgrading Photoshop was the Adobe Raw plug-in.

Some useful resources:

1.  [Lightroom Getting Started Guide][] - An absolute must read. This is
    really the manual that should have shipped with Lightroom
2.  [Inside Adobe Lightroom][] ([rss][]) - O'Reilly blog with lots of
    great writers, including recently switched [JDD][].
3.  [Lightroom Killer Tips][] - from Matt of the [Photoshop Guys][],
    subscribe in iTunes and learn from the experts.
4.  [Flickr integration][] - not great, but until a proper plug-in
    ships, a reasonable stop gap.
5.  [The DAM Book][DAM] - not Lightroom specific, but great for the
    concepts of Digital Asset Management (ie. how to store your photos).

The next step for me is to actually sort out my own DAM procedures. My
archival process is rather ad-hoc. At least I know what I should be
doing and have some of the required tools.
