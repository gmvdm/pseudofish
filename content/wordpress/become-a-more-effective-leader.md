[Manager Tools][] (MT) is a weekly podcast that provides free training
on how to be a more effective manager and leader. The hosts have an
extensive background in coaching managers and executives.

Management is a skill and it can be learned. Typically it is not taught
well, if at all; MT teaches it effectively.

If you’re thinking, “but I’m not a manager, I won’t benefit”, then you’d
be wrong. Even if you don’t manage other people, you manage your own
time and interact into a larger organization. The skills taught by MT
are beneficial to anyone who works for a corporation.

These guys have been podcasting since 2005. There is some benefit to
going right back to the start, but if you want to catch up there is a
subset of casts that are considered “[core][]”.

I’ve found this podcast to be the best source of on-going knowledge
about management, leadership, and communication. Each cast is designed
to teach specific actions you can take today.

MT was originally recommended to me be a [friend][] at CSIRO. Since then
I've listened to most of the episodes. It is that good.
