There is a school of thought that a blog is a useful tool for personal
development - a tool for change. Learning a new programming API is only
part of what blogsphere participation has achieved.

</p>

A year of blogging has passed since I started this [blog][]:

</p>
<p>
> </p>
> My initial aim for this site is to follow my progress of figuring out
> how to write a Cocoa application using Python.
>
> <p>

</p>

I've gone through a lot of changes, largely motivated by a desire to
discover what I'm passionate about. This led me from being a respected
manager to a rookie employee in a new state with new peers and a new
industry to learn.

</p>

This blog was originally intended to investigate a few things:

</p>

-   A return to hands-on product creation; programming
-   Learning Cocoa and Python
-   Finding out about blogging
-   Improving my writing style

</p>

These are on-going lessons to be learnt, and will remain in focus.
However, I am also going to broaden my scope. This has been slowly
happening over the last few months.

</p>

On the way to discovering what I enjoy, what I'm passionate about, I
found *light* as a starting point. This has evolved into a fairly
healthy photography hobby, and has kept my plugging away at Photoshop
over the years. I think I am now considered *intermediate*. I'm going to
focus a bit more on design too, of both software and everyday things.

</p>

My restated goals for the site are:

</p>

-   Enhance existing programming knowledge: Haskell, web, Cocoa/Python,
    DB, QT
    </p>
    <p>
-   New programming topics: OpenGL, and other graphics processing
    </p>
    <p>
-   Communication, such as blogging and my recent Toastmasters
    experiences
    </p>
    <p>
-   Things I'm working on at now: C++, Qtopia, Embedded Devices
    </p>
    <p>
-   Design aspects: Photography, Photoshop, Software and User Interfaces
-   Include more personal thoughts in my writing

</p>

This last point is a chance to include more of my life, and hopefully
focussing on communication will keep the clich√© count down.

</p>

With the revision of focus, the tag line for the site is changing. Gone
is "Can a snake (*Python*) eat chocolate (*Cocoa*)", and in is "Beauty
through design".

</p>

Has blogging been worth the effort? Totally! I'm very excited about
where it will lead next.

ps. I will be sparse on contact for the next few weeks as I journey
through China and Norway.
