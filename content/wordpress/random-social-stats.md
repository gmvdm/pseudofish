-   472 contacts in AddressBook
-   234 RSS feeds subscribed to

-   102 Facebook friends
-   55 Pseudofish RSS subscribers
-   50 MySpace friends
-   16 Flickr contacts

Based on [Dunbar's research][], 150 is the theoretical maximum size of a
well formed social group.

Assuming that I know some people in the offline world, and that there is
some overlap in the groups above, it is still feasible that I've
exceeded the limit. This means I'm either spending excessive time
keeping in contact, or that I'm not keeping up my end.

</p>

As such, my apologies.

</p>

The new social software seems to create a trend towards large numbers of
shallow relationships. Although, it may be a symptom of other social
problems that lead to a similar result.

</p>

The question that is puzzling me -- What does the society of tomorrow
look like? I guess time will tell.
