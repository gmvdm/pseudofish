[Newsday][] highlights the 50^th^ anniversary of the classic text on
English grammar and writing style.

This is *the* book on the subject.

I considered offering my copy out for loan. However, I would not be
happy without a copy in my possession. It is a [small book][], and you
owe yourself an [edition][] of it.

It saddens me that writing style seems a fading art. This book is not
read enough.
