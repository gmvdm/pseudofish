Nassim Taleb revised his [book][] on the way humans deal with
randomness; how we rationalize luck. It is worth a read. (Recommended by
the likes of [Tom Peters][], and [Peter Bernstein][]).

The part that grabbed my attention was Nassim's use of [Monte Carlo][]
simulations, to test out scenarios. The simulator allows exploration of
alternate paths, both past and future. Evolution is a search technique
to find successful survival strategies for a particular scenario. In
biology, we have only one scenario to investigate: ours. The Monte Carlo
simulator allows testing strategies under different scenarios.

This is very similar to the work on complexity theory being done at the
Santa Fe institute (as told in the [Origin of Wealth][]). Nassim refers
to their work later in the book:

> The so-called *complexity theorists* came to the rescue. ... Clearly

> solutions in the physical sciences and better models in the social
> siblings (though nothing satisfactory there yet).

The key is the *yet*.

I'm holding out hope for complexity theory as applied to economics and
finance. The classical equilibrium models don't resonate strongly with
my understanding of this world. Early research into the application of
complexity theory rings very true.

Even if the numbers don't hold out exactly, the model provided matches
my understanding of people and markets much better. Nassim himself says
it best:

> Mathematics is principally a tool to meditate, rather than compute.

Lets hope it can deliver both.
