Title: Learning Photography on the Web

Ansel Adams' instructional series ([Camera][], [Negative][], [Print][])
was my introduction to photography. Over the last month or two, I found
some wonderful other fonts of knowledge on the web. These have given me
a more rounded understanding.

</p>

[Alain Briot's][] 11 part series, [Aesthetics and Photography][], is the
best set of articles I have read. Starts at the beginning with an
article on [How to see Photographically][] and continues through general
photographic theory.

</p>

The advantage of this series is that it is about photography as an art
form, not specifically digital photography. The included artwork is
inspiring and the focus on landscapes struck a chord. This is an artist
who is able to write well. The series continues on to topics such as
[Personal Style][] and [Being an Artist][].

</p>

As a bonus, the rest of the [Luminous Landscape][] site is packed full
of helpful articles. Especially true if you have an interest in outdoor
photography.

</p>

[Digital Outback Photography][] is another site with a range of good
content, including a simple [tutorial][] that covers a little bit of
everything. They also have heaps of useful reviews that are from the
perspective of actually using the camera.

</p>

Their [350d][] review was helpful in deciding between the 30D and 350D.
I ended up going for the 350d on the theory that I can then focus on
useful accessories, such as lenses.

</p>

[Strobist][] has been a recent find that has heaps of content on using
light in photography. An area that I've not had much exposure to, I'm
looking forward to reading more of this blog.

</p>

-   [General Theory][] - strive for layers of interest
-   [Lighting 101][]
-   [Strobist on Assignment][] - tips from real assignments
-   [Buying equipment][]

</p>

Darren, of [Pro Blogger][] fame, has started a photography site:
[Digital Photography School][]. Contains useful information for
beginners to intermediate. There are some strikingly obvious things that
are useful to be reminded of, or to discover I didn't know.

</p>

Some recent articles at [DPS][Digital Photography School] include:

</p>

-   [Silhouettes][]
-   [The Zoom Effect][] - games to play with a zoom!
-   [How to hold a digital camera][] - obvious, but always worth review
-   [Pets][] - useful if you just bought a kitten
