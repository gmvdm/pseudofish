Summary: The process I went through to pick a Chinese name.

My Chinese name is 周浩轩 (Zhōu hào xuān).

[Choosing a name](http://eastasiastudent.net/china/how-to-get-a-chinese-name)
is hard. I had early Chinese names, but they were accidental. One from
Chinese class, where our teacher randomly gave us names, and one from my
translated Chinese business card (威尔森 - wēi ěr sēn - Wilson).

For the last [year](http://pseudofish.com/update-on-learning-chinese.html), I
have been working with the same tutor, and I asked her to help. Chinese names
are typically associated with meaning. To start, I listed out the sorts of
traits I valued in a name. From here, she came up with a list of around ten
suggestions.

The challenge was which one?

I started by putting them all into a
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q_DtQpFfO_42wRcsqd6fYoflZOd7gzTSdEbLvtY9ha8/edit#gid=0),
and expanding out pinyin, as I didn't know all the characters. I found that
you could check names on RenRen ([人人](http://name.renren.com/)). This let me
figure out a rough popularity, and gender balance. For a final sanity check, I
also searched for the name on [Baidu](http://image.baidu.com/) images to see
if there were any bad associations.

After gathering the data, I was down to two candidates, and picked the one
that I liked the characters of.

I decided on Zhou [周](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_(surname)) as a
surname by a more random approach. I looked through
[two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames)
[lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname) of popular Chinese
surnames. After avoiding names of friends, some musing, reading up on
history and famous people with particular names, I picked.
