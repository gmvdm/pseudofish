Canon's new [5D][] has [started shipping][] in the US.

[Australian shipping][] is a bit of a guess. Rumor is for the end of the
week (28^th^ Nov). Mine is on pre-order from [Cameras Direct][]. They
stopped taking any more pre-orders. Hopefully, they are close with Canon
and can ship this week.

China is a bit luckier, as it is [already available][] in selected
camera stores.

<u>Bonus:</u> Video editing tutorials for FCP and the 5D.

Adobe has also updated [Camera Raw][] to support the 5D Mark II.
Lightroom update to follow in December.
