An interesting read by [Tom Coates][] about an advertising firm (maybe)
using comment spam to promote cleaning products.

Linked via [Hugh][]

I've been seeing more and more random comment spam on this blog, which
Wordpress filters for me, but it still requires moderation. Fortunately,
none has gotten through (so far) with vigilance taking up more time. Now
even the legitimate looking comments seem to require checking.

Luckily, Cocoa development in Python is a fairly niche audience. I'm
sure some of the bigger blogs are having even bigger issues with spam,
which will be why comments get disabled on a lot of them.

I'm almost in agreement with [Seth Godin][] that if you want to have the
conversation, start your own blog and then link back to the article.
Almost.

Update: And now [an apology][] after the fact.
