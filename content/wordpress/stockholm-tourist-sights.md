This is my current list of things to do and see if you happen to be
visiting Stockholm for a weekend or a bit longer. The list is based on
things we've seen, or that friends have found.

### Sights

</p>

-   [Vasa Museum][] — an old ship that has been preserved due to failure
    to launch. Interesting museum on maritime history. There are
    sometimes queues to get in, so may be worth a morning visit.
-   [Nordic Museum][] — provides a history of the nordic region, and is
    just near the Vasa Museum.
-   [Skansen][] — an open air museum / zoo / cultural centre. This whole
    park is quite large, so it is worth spending a full day, as there is
    lots to do. A good chance to see reindeer and moose in Stockholm.
-   [Fotographiska][] — a photography museum / gallery on Södermalm.
    Three floors of photography, with a nice café with a view of
    Stockholm on the top floor.
-   [Modern Art Museum][] — meant to be quite good, but still on my todo
    list.
-   [Gamla Stan][] - well worth half a day wandering around, see the
    palace, explore the streets. Almost everything is over priced, but
    then it is the main tourist district. It also has some of the better
    restaurants in town.
    </p>
    <p>
-   [Södermalm][] — itself is one of the nicer areas of Stockholm. The
    shore of the island on the south is a popular place for hanging out.
    There are lots of nice restaurants near Slussen on the northern side
    too. The cliffs above Slussen provide a good vantage point to see
    Galma Stan (old town) and the city in general.
-   [Östermalm][] — a nice area in between the city centre and
    Djurgården island (where the Vasa & Skansen are). Lots of nice cafés
    to pass the day in.
-   Boat trips — there are ferries that shuttle between the various
    islands and make a nice way to get from Skeppholmen to Djurgården.
-   [Stockholm Archipelago][] — this city is all about islands, and
    there are a number of boat cruises that leave for the [wider
    Archipelago][Stockholm Archipelago]. We visited Fjäderholmarna,
    which is small and close and made for a nice place to wander around.
    The article has some info on boats, they also depart from near
    Östermalm.

### Restaurants

</p>

-   [Rival Hotel][] — the restaurant here is worth a visit, a short walk
    from Mariatorget station
-   [Gondolen][] — quite a cool location for a restaurant, suspended
    underneath a bridge near Slussen station. We went for drinks at
    their bar, which gives a good view of Stockholm. If you want a seat
    at the restaurant, it is worth booking ahead.
-   [Vete-Katten][] — Downtown is mostly shops, however if you’re
    wandering around and looking for somewhere for lunch, Vete-Katten
    has a great range of traditional Swedish cakes.
-   [Den Gyldene Freden][] — modern take on tradition Swedish food. We
    found the service to be friendly.
-   [Sturehof][] — interesting restaurant in Östermalm.
-   [Pelikan][] — Swedish home style food.
-   [Oliver Twist][] (House of Ale) — cozy pub in the midst of Södermalm
    with a good range of local beers and hearty pub food. Bookings
    recommended, although we've been lucky before.
-   [Djuret][] — means "the animal" in Swedish, and they only serve one
    animal at a time. Interesting concept, and has been recommended to
    me.

### Transport

</p>

To get around, it is worth getting tickets for the underground train
line (Tunnelbana, abbreviated to large signs with a T). It runs pretty
much everywhere and will make it easier to see the city.

</p>

To transfer from the airport, taxi works out cost effective if there are
more than one person travelling. Otherwise, the train system is fast and
easy to navigate.

For Swedish, [DN.se][] and for Swedish restaurant reviews try [På
Stan][] (with [Google translate][] to help).

### Language Basics

</p>

Almost everyone here speaks perfect English as their second language, so
knowing some Swedish isn’t important. That said, some pleasantries
always helps.

</p>

These few phrases will get you far:

</p>

-   Hej (pron. “Hey!) — hello, or goodbye, general greeting.
-   Hej då (pron. “Hey door”) — goodbye.
-   Tack — thanks, and please. Pointing at something and saying tack, or
    saying tack after receiving something is common. You’ll hear this
    word a lot.
-   Tack så mycket (pron. “Tack so mickey”) — thank you very much, often
    used at the end of transactions.
