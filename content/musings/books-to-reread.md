Summary: Some books in my queue that I'd consider re-reading
status: draft

It is rare that I go back and re-read books. However, some books have left an
impact and I would or have read again.

This list started as a folder on my Kindle. As I'm migrating to a Nexus 7, I
wanted to write them down. I added in some that I have as physical books too.
This list is for non-fiction books.

## The Hard Thing about Hard Things (Ben Horowitz)

## The Principals of Product Development Flow (Donald G. R...)

## Leading Change (John P. Kotter)

## Good Strategy, Bad Strategy (Richard Rumelt)

## Zen Mind, Beginners Mind (Shunryu Suzuki)

## How to Measure Anything (Douglas W. Hub ..)

## The Lean Startup (Eric Reis)

## High Output Management (Andy Grove)
