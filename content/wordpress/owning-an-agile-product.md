One of the challenges in running a successful agile project is having a

Some quotes:

> Creating any product can be challenge. With a product being developed

>
> What teams need most is a product owner who is able to prioritize the
> product backlog.
>
> It's the product owner's responsibility to know and communicate a
> product vision for the team. Knowing where you want to go enables you
> to reach your destination; the details of getting there we all
> discover along the way.
>
> Product owners must be able to earn the respect of the team, resolve
> conflicts through conversations, and adjust priorities accordingly.
> There are whole books dedicated to managing conflicts. Learning when
> to take a stand and when to give is important. It is more important,
> though, that everyone has a voice.
>
> Be concerned about creating a stable environment for the team members
> to learn and contribute. It's imperative that you keep the team from
> being distracted.
>
> The product owner is not a dictated hierarchy, but a service role. The
> customer, the team, and the company are all tuned around the product
> by the product owner.
