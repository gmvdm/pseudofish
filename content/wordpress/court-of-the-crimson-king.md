[Robert Fripp][] has long inhabited my music collection. I inherited an
[old LP][] and then was hooked. His collaborations with Brian Eno have
produced some [beautiful music][] that I'd rank amongst my favorites.

Recent collaborations are even more interesting. Robert has been
involved with a little corporation in Redmond to produce the sounds for
their new operating system, Vista.

Robert Scoble managed to film the experience for [Channel 9][]. Worth a
watch, if only for the first part where Fripp [plays the guitar][Channel
9].
