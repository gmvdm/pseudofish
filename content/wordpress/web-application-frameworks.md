I've been thinking about building a web application that behaves more
like a desktop application. Think MobileMe, GMail, Google Docs, etc.

This post collects together some of the research that I've been doing so
I can refer back to it.

SproutCore

-   [Homepage][]
-   [SproutCore on Wikipedia][]
-   [Getting Started][]

Cappuccino

-   [Homepage][1]
-   [Cappuccino on Wikipedia][]
-   [Tutorials][]

Raphaël

-   [Homepage][2]
-   [Raphaël on Wikipedia][]
-   [Drag & Drop support][]

There is a few places that have a comparison between some of these,
including:

-   [SproutCore vs Cappuccino][] (stackoverflow)
-   [SproutCore and Cappuccino][] (stackoverflow) - if you use Cocoa,
    pick Cappuccino, else use SproutCore.
-   [To SproutCore, or not to SproutCore][]
-   [Building a Project Planning App][] (ruby or rails oceania)

From my current reading, my inclination is to dive deeper into
SproutCore. Apple and [Yehuda][] seem to be investing a lot into it.
That said, Cappuccino looks quite interesting.

*Update:* [This][] article provides a good summary of large scale
development using Javascript.
