Title: Changing Names

Summary: Changing my name to van der Meer.

After filling in many forms, I am now Geoff van der Meer.

The paperwork part of the story is long, uninteresting, and never
ending. Changing ones name as an Australian while living in Sweden just isn't
simple.

The why is shorter. My wife and I chose to use van der Meer, my
mother-in-law's maiden name, as the family name for our future children. van
der Meer is a Dutch surname, and translates to English as "of the lake".

My wife changed her name earlier this year.  This left me with a few choices:
either keep my current name and be different from my family, hyphenate things,
or change my name.

The idea of having "Wilson-van der Meer" as a name didn't resonate. Neither
did having a different name from my immediate family.

So, a bunch of bureaucracy later, I have a new name.

I will still keep _gmwils_. That was allocated to me at university,
and has been my username, email address, Twitter name and many other
identifiers for more years than I care to count.
