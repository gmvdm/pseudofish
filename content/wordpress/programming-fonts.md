James Duncan Davidson writes a bit about fixed width fonts on Mac OS X:

-   [The case for Bitstream Vera Sans Mono][], a font distributed with
    Gnome.
-   [Quicklook and Fonts][].
-   and, [A sorting problem with fonts.][]

I've long been a fan of Monaco with anti-aliasing for my Terminal font,
but I'm now sold on Panic Sans. John Gruber mentioned it in his [link
blog][], it comes with [Coda][] and is based on Bitstream Vera Sans with
better punctuation.

Sold.
