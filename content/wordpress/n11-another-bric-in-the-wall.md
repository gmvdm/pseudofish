This week's [Economist][] has a special report on international banking.
With the rise in new types of financial instruments, and private equity
firms, this is a very timely discussion.

With increased competition, the banks are [scouring the globe][] for new
markets to shore up their business.

Currently, the expansions have been into so-called *BRIC* markets
(Brazil, Russia, India, China). The next horizon for expansion has been
dubbed by Goldman as N11 and includes the following:

-   Bangladesh
-   Egypt
-   Indonesia
-   Iran
-   South Korea
-   Mexico
-   Nigeria
-   Pakistan
-   the Philippines
-   Turkey
-   Vietnam

This is not a set of economies without risk. However, as the global
investment banks set up shop, easier access to western style financial
controls should improve matters.
