[Richard Jones][] has posted [Bruce][], the presentation software he
used at the recent [OSDC][].

</p>

Various presentation software was used during the conference along with
many presentation styles. The ones that stuck out the most were the
typical corporate slides in PowerPoint. Usually, as I feel asleep or
played on my laptop during these. [Presentation Zen][] needs to be read
by many presenters, especially if they missed Paul's [presentation][].

</p>

The presentation that had the greatest impact at showing live code was
Richard's using Bruce. With PyGame as a back end, there was no
application swapping between the demo and the slides. The demos were
contained within the slides!

</p>

Another interesting presentation platform was [Autrijus's][]. His talk
was built using XUL, the scripting platform created by the Mozilla team.
The slides he used are available on his [site][Autrijus's] and you need
to follow the link using Firefox to view them. He has even been
referenced (unattributed) by a site listing their [top five][] speakers!
