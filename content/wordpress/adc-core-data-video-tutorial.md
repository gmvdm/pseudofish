See [here][] for details on a new tutorial on Core Data.

</p>

In the vein of Ruby on Rails style video presentations, you can download
the narrated video ([38Mb][]) and learn very quickly how to put together
a Core Data application.

</p>

Note: for the bandwidth challenged, it is broken down into smaller
pieces on the [ADC site][].

</p>

As someone who is largely self taught on the Cocoa side of things, it
was instructive to watch another developer at work with Apple's tools.
Aside from learning about Core Data, I learnt some productivity
improvements for using Interface Builder and XCode.

</p>

If you are writing Cocoa apps, this is well worth a watch!
