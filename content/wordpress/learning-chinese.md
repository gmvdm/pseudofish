Title: Learning Chinese

After almost two years of study, there are many different approaches
I've tried for learning Chinese. These are the ones that stuck the most.
I'm putting them into order of terms effectiveness, however I do get
excited about ones I most recently discovered. My aim is to be able to
speak Chinese via MSN with friends. This is going to take time.

I am biased towards the iPhone for software. Access to a dictionary, to
learn on the go, is invaluable.

1.  [ACCS][] - I recommend attending class. It helps for motivation. It
    helps to learn with a teacher. It helps to be encouraged by peer
    pressure if you fall behind your classmates. ACCS helps me learn to
    speak and to learn how to read & write characters. Try and find a
    class in your local area.
2.  [ChinesePod][] - useful for both their regular podcast and forums.
    The best podcast on the internet, although now mostly hidden behind
    a paid wall. I'm yet to consider paying as am still working through
    their back catalogue. [Jenny][] and Ken provide a lively dynamic
    that make learning fun.
3.  [Dianhua Dictionary][] - comprehensive Chinese/English dictionary on
    a phone for free. Hard not to like. Combined with native input
    methods and can search using pinyin or by drawing characters. I also
    use a hard copy Oxford Chinese/English dictionary on occasion, but
    it mostly stays on the shelf.
4.  [iVocabulary][] / ProVoc - flash card system with a Mac based
    desktop app(free) and an iPhone client. Creating paper flash cards
    was never going to happen. Putting this on the computer helped.
    Getting it to my phone means I actually study.
5.  Visiting China - at the moment I feel quite swamped by almost
    everything being in Chinese. That said, two weeks in China is doing
    great things for my Chinese. Hopefully, it provides motivation to
    continue. Spending time without a translator helps too.
6.  Chinese movies - watch many, in Mandarin. If you're enthusiastic,
    watch with Mandarin subtitles instead of English. You understand
    less of the film, but learn more of the language.
7.  Chinese books / newspapers / etc - Aim to read something written by
    native speakers that doesn't live in a text book or language course.
    I find the educational material can be contrived.
8.  [italki.com][] - social networking site for meeting people to
    exchange language with. Still not fully sure of the usefulness, but
    seems to be an easy way to meet people who want to learn English and
    are native Chinese speakers. There are other sites that offer
    similar features.
9.  Lonely Planet - phrase book is helpful, iPhone app is useful if
    you're stranded or forget the basics. To be honest though, I rarely
    refer to it anymore.
10. [Twitter][] - Adding people from China is helpful, but hasn't led to
    as much learning of language as I had thought. That said, I'm
    learning a heap about culture and current events. Try following
    [@YoukuBuzz][] for video content.

Note: I just found some [MIT courses][] that are published online that
include a few with Chinese. One even comes with a [free text book][] in
PDF form. I have not spent much time with it, but it looks promising.

Some of the resources will be useful for whichever language you are
learning. If you aren't learning a language other than your own, ask
yourself why not? Learning a language will teach you a new culture and
broaden your horizons. Worth the time. My challenge is not getting
confused between English, German and Chinese.
