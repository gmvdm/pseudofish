M & I are starting a food blog here: [Dreaming of Winter][].

</p>

After spending the start of this year doing lots of wonderful cooking
and shooting a bunch of photos to go with it, turning the passion into a
blog made lots of sense.

</p>

The theme is based on our mutual love of winter. Hearty winter soups,
rich roast meats and delightful desserts. There may be some lighter
summer fare, but don't count on it.

</p>

I also started another [photography blog][] where I intend to post about
recent shoots, something I've avoided going into too much detail with on
this blog.
