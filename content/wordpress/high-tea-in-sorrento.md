After being overly busy with work, a weekend in Melbourne allowed for
relaxing travel. Michelle and I went down to Sorrento to visit a friend
for high tea.

Lots and lots of cakes, some beautiful sandwiches and then more cakes.
All mixed in with a wide variety of tea. Conversations were diverse and
drifted between deep and idyllic.

A wonderful way to unwind.

It was also a good opportunity to play more with my new camera. I am
really pleased with the results. The colors out of camera are more
inspiring than from my old camera.
