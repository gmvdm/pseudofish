[Kanban][] is a scheduling system for work items that I'm exploring
further.

I heard about it from several sources, but didn't focus my attention
until earlier this year.

I highly recommend [Kanban][1] by David J Anderson. He is someone who is
a practitioner as well as an author, which really helps in his
explanations.

His book is broken up into four sections:

-   Introduction
-   Benefits of Kanban
-   Implementing Kanban
-   Making improvements

Each section is filled with references to industry theory, both in
software and manufacturing, and liberally sprinkled with case studies
from his own companies.

One part that really resonated with me is that introducing Kanban layers
over the top of an existing development process. That is, you do not
need to change your current process. Instead, the focus is on scheduling
the work that goes into the process.

This makes Kanban a logical fit for processes such as Agile, as well as
more traditional iterative or even waterfall development projects.

From the book:

> Kanban is an approach that drives change by optimizing your existing
> process. The essence of starting with Kanban is to change as little as
> possible. You must resist the temptation to change workflow, job
> titles, roles and responsibilities, and specific working practices.
> Everything from which the team members and other partners,
> participants, and stakeholders derive their self-esteem, professional
> pride, and ego should be left unchanged.
>
> The main target of change will be the quantity of WIP and the
> interface to and interaction with upstream and downstream parts of
> your business. So you must work with your team to map the value stream
> as it exists. Try not to change it or invent it in an idealistic
> fashion

As with any new area of knowledge, I feel like I've only scratched the
surface. The interesting part is the range of topics to explore further,
such as [Deming's writing][].

It is also helpful to be working with teams that have already
implemented many of the techniques from Kanban process, and to hear
first hand stories of their implementation.
