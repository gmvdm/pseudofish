Summary: The process I went through to pick a Chinese name.
status: draft

My new Chinese name is 周浩轩 (Zhou1 hao4 xuan1).

Trying to [pick a name](http://eastasiastudent.net/china/how-to-get-a-chinese-name) is
hard, both to find one that matches me, and that doesn't sound odd in Chinese.

First was from a group class, and I wasn't confident with it.

Also had a transliteration of my surname on previous business cards (picture?)

This time, wanted to do it properly. Asked my tutor, who I've been working
with for a while. Suggested a bunch of associations with a name that I'd like:

> these are the characters with water or river or sea, and all of these names
> means broad-minded, honest, etc

Got a list of suggestions. Put into spreadsheet:

Checked on renren:

For number of people (eg. popularity) and gender.

Then also searched on Baidu images for graphical associations. Some were
places, some had random pictures. Some had pictures of real people.

Discussed my choice with my Chinese teacher to figure out deeper meaning.

I decided on Zhou [周](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_(surname)) as a
surname by a more random approach. I started with
[two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames)
[lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname) of popular Chinese
surnames. After avoiding names of friends, some musing, and reading up on
history and famous people with particular names, I picked.

One last sanity check was to ask my Chinese teacher if the full name made
sense, and then I was done.
