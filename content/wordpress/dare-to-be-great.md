The [ETL series][] has been consistently good, and the recent lectures
have continued the tradition.

</p>

A question posed by [Jackie Speier][], a former senator, really got me
thinking:

</p>

<p>
> What would you do if you knew you could not fail?

</p>

The thing that struck me was that I have no easy answer for this
question.

</p>

I don't know.

</p>

Fortunately, it is the kind of question that if you spend time thinking
of an answer, you're getting somewhere. Even without an answer, the path
towards an answer is constructive.

</p>

So, what would you do if you knew you could not fail?
