Title: Web Feed workflow

Having just returned from nine days snowboarding with no internet
access, I'm presented with the daunting task of *catching up*. Work and
my few personal email accounts weren't too bad, with unread counts in
the low hundreds. However, NetNewsWire was happily advising me that I
had over 600 unread posts.

I've grouped my feeds into groups that are roughly topic based, but also
based on whether I can live without reading them. This allowed me to
simple mark as read about half the unread count. I've probably missed
some things, but they were likely to be things I could live without.

What troubles me is the remaining posts. There is probably about half of
those that I will want to catch up on. The catch is that I won't know
which half until working my way through them all. I'm not sure if this
is a good or a bad thing.

On one hand, I won't miss things that I would normally have missed by my
previous web browsing workflow (visit sites and check). On the flip
side, I'm now getting rather close to information overload. The next
step from here is to try and cull out feeds that I'm not as interested
in.

At least I can listen to tunes on my iPod nano while I sort it all out.
