[Various][] [pundits][] have been calling newspapers down and out in the
media game. The reality, however, is not that simple. Instead, changing
consumer interest has resulted in shifting demands for print media. Some
companies are adapting to the changes, some will fall.

[Steve Rubel][] points to [data][] on the rise magazine advertising:

> According to the Magazine Publishers of America, magazine advertising
> pages climbed to nearly 250,000 pages last year. While they're down
> from their 2000 high of 286,000 pages, the trend line has been going
> up

And his analysis:

> People like to peruse Vogue and GQ for the latest fashions and the ads
> are part of the experience. Second, I think it's also because
> magazines are by their nature vertical and they allow people to dig
> deeper into the subjects that interest them.

I think the point of segmentation by verticals is the key here. The win
is on two levels. On one hand, it engages the reader so boosts
circulation. On the other hand, provides a targeted demographic to
advertisers, thus boosting revenue and the quality of the product.

Not all magazines are winning:

> ... the rising tide is not lifting all boats. Time and Newsweek are
> both suffering as news really moves to the Web.

This gels with [the comments][] of Peter Read Miller, a Sports
Illustrated photographer, about the trends of his magazine. During his
tenure, SI has gone from breaking the news of the games results, to a
focus on the story behind the games. The four day lead time from the
game to the publication is too long for SI to be first with the news.

Newspapers have much shorter lead times, typically a day, allowing them
to have stayed relevant for longer. By having breaking news move to the
web, the lead time expected by media consumers is now measured in hours
or minutes, not days.

As with the magazine industry, some papers have failed to adjust to the
change in their customer's consumption of news. However, there are news
groups that are bucking the trend.

A local example, is the Fairfax media group. Through some very smart
moves their circulation is at a [12 year high][].

For example, one of their major publications, the Age, is segmented into
a host of magazine style sections. Each section is high in content,
color, advertising, and is often in a tabloid paper size. This makes the
entire paper, in essence, a collection of magazines.

They are also ahead of the local market in offerings such as blogs,
photo slideshows and video content on their [website][], and have
decided to reduce the physical width of the paper by[5cm][]. (This last
one is a big deal for a newspaper).

Perhaps part of their success has been in staying local. There is much
speculation on the web that local is the next battle ground.

From [Don Dodge][]:

> Local search is a huge opportunity. The local newspapers are in a
> great position to own it...but they don't.

And [Tom Evslin][]:

> The importance of these statistics is that there is now a critical
> mass of people who can and will take advantage of and interact with
> rich LOCAL content.

Newspapers are inherently local. They have relationships with end
consumers through their circulation department, and with local
advertisers through ad sales. In the next few years, successful media
groups will be making better use of these key assets.

My read on the industry? Newspapers are far from dead, but the market is
changing around them. This will cause pain for some, while providing
much opportunity to those prepared for change.

I expect to see even more consolidation in the coming years, such as
Rupert Murdoch's offer for [Dow Jones][]. This will allow media groups
to further diversify their publications, much as Google has diversified
their web offerings.
