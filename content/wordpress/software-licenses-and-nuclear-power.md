In a recent [sample][] from Sun, I noticed the following in their
license:

     * You acknowledge that this software is not designed, licensed or * intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance * of any nuclear facility.

Given that the example code was for using MIDP apps to interface with a
web service, I think I'm happy for the exclusion. Pondering being able
to meltdown a nuclear reactor from a bug my cell phone.

Now that's scary.
