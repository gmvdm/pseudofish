From [The Origin of Wealth][]:

> Markets win over command and control, not because of their

Evolution, genetic algorithms and complexity theory, as applied to
economics: It is a search problem.

</p>

This book foretells the demise of economic theories based on
equilibrium. To tell the story, a wide path is walked through the
history of economics, advanced computer science, physics and some chaos
theory. Very interesting reading, if you are interested in economics, or
why economics works or doesn't (quite) work.
