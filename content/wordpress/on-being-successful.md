Career advice from Dilbert's [Scott Adams][]:

> But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:
>
> 1.  Become the best at one specific thing.
> 2.  Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.
>
> The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility.

Business advice from [Chase Jarvis][]:

> [shoot] what's not out there.
>
> - from [this interview][] (about 41 minutes in)

innovative [portfolio][] and his continued success.
