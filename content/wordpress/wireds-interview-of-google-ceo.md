Eric Schmidt was [interviewed][] recently by Wired. Some of the
hightlights from the discussion include:

### Architecture

> Now, with the Internet protocols you can pretty much plug in your own
> interpretation of how email should work and your own interpretation of
> how voice over IP should work.

And so was spawned a swarm of Web 2.0 companies all attempting to
re-invent the wheel, now in a web browser. The interesting piece for me
is the potential of sync. [Newsgator][] is my favourite for this
(multiple clients all sync'd to a central server allowing online and
offline).

> Google docs and spreadsheets don't work if you're on an airplane. But
> it's a technical problem that is going to get solved. Eventually you
> will be able to work on a plane as if you are connected and, then when
> you get reconnected to the Internet, your computer will just
> synchronize with the cloud.

Could I have this? Please? Like yesterday?

### Advertising

> The other interesting thing about pageviews is that we make our money
> by improving the quality, not the quantity, of ads showed on a page.
> This is very confusing to people. In a normal media business, you make
> money by showing more ads.

### Organizational Structure

Google's biggest scaling problem may actually be their culture. It is
obviously something on their CEO's mind.

> It's a constant problem. We analyze this every day, and our conclusion
> is that the best model remains small teams running as fast as they can
> and tolerating a certain lack of cohesion. The attempt to provide
> order drives out the creativity. And so it's a balance.

### Innovation

> Virtually all of the innovation at the company is still coming out of
> 20 percent time.

Innovation doesn't happen by accident, it happens due to a good
environment that encourages it. Part of this is allocating time to let
it happen. The other part is providing incentives. At Google, a good 20
percent time project has the potential to turn into a fully branded
Google product. One heck of a carrot for a developer.

### Search

> We also know Google News, for example, which we don't monetize, has
> had a tremendous impact on searches and on query quality. We know
> those people search more. Because we've measured it.

Interesting.

There is a lot of useful information in the interview and it is well
worth a [read][].
