Deciding on a new lens is hard. There are many options and many factors
to consider, such as your photographic style, cost, and build quality.

My approach is to look at times when there are photos I have missed due
to not having a particular capability in my kit. The area that I've
noticed this of late has been at the wide end of the spectrum. I own a
wide angle lens, but as it is the kit lens, it doesn't spend much time
on the camera. Time for an upgrade.

The lens I selected is the [17-40mm f/4][] Canon. I used [this web
site][] to compare the different capabilities of the lenses I was
considering, and used amazon in the US for a rough guide to prices.

Once I decided on the lens, purchasing it becomes tricky. The cost of
buying glass in Melbourne is not small if you walk into a camera store.
I was lucky enough to be flying through Hong Kong and Canada, so had
some more options.

Here is a comparison of prices I found when hunting, to give you an idea
of the differences:

-   $1,439.00 [Canon][] recommended retail price
-   $955 + shipping, [photobuff][], Australian online retailer
-   $918 [Don's photo][], downtown Winnipeg
-   $900.00 Hong Kong shops, Stanley Street in Central
-   $851.00 + shipping + maybe import tax, [mpex.com][], US online
    retailer
-   $799 + $80 shipping + maybe import tax, [ebay.com.au][], via HK
    online retailer

There is also the fun of calculating various taxes, and considering the
risk associated with returns and warranty claims. In the past, I bought
my 70-200 f/4 from mpex.com and had no problems with shipping.

This time, I collected the lens from Don's Photo in Winnipeg as there
were a few other bits I also wanted to grab. They ended up doing me a
good deal on the whole sale, and I'm confident that I can return it to
them should there be a need.

The process is simply too hard. Unfortunately, due to the cost of glass
in Australia, I'm likely to have to revisit this process on my next
purchase.

If you know any other places to get reliable and cheap sales of Canon
lenses, let me know in the comments.
