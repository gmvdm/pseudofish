Two books have a profound impact on me, [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance][] and [The Alchemist][].

</p>

The central theme of the books is a quest for meaning in the world. They
take different journeys to the discovery of meaning, through inimitable
prose. I highly recommend both books.

</p>

I recently left much that I held dear, in terms of city, employment and
many friends in a larger quest to find meaning in my own life.

As a child I wanted to be able to do something memorable, that had an
impact on the future of humanity. This led me to a range of ideals, from
scientist, to teacher, to engineer.

</p>

My current believe is that my path to significant meaning is the
creation of an organization that in turn creates meaning. Guy Kawasaki
put it like this:

I'm not there yet. I have not even figured out what sort of company I
should create or what type of meaning it should strive for. The
important part is to take the first steps along the path, the rest will
become known through action.

</p>

For now, I'm largely focused on self improvement and being able to
enrich the lives of those around me. Beyond here lies the realm of
possibility.
