> Take the New York City taxi story. Two years ago, David Yassky, a City

> technology entrepreneur, to brainstorm about how to make New York City
> greener — at scale. For starters, they checked with the Taxi and
> Limousine Commission to see what it would take to replace the old
> gas-guzzling Crown Victoria yellow cabs, which get around 10 miles a
> gallon, with better-mileage, low-emission hybrids.

> On May 22, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the greenest mayors in

> the taxi commission has to approve, that will not just permit but
> *require* all cabs — 13,000 in all — to be hybrids or other
> low-emission vehicles that get at least 30 miles a gallon, within five

> This is how scale change happens. When the Big Apple becomes the Green

> So if you want to be a green college kid or a green adult, don’t fool
