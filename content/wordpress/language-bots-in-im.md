Instant message bots are all the rage at the moment. [Twitter][] has an
IM bot, [Google][] has recently provided language translation via
instant messaging.

For example, invite `en2zh@bot.talk.google.com` to be your friend on
Google Talk and it will translate English text to Chinese.

> There are 24 bots currently available: ar2en, de2en, de2fr, el2en,
> en2ar, en2de, en2el, en2es, en2fr, en2it, en2ja, en2ko, en2nl, en2ru,
> en2zh, es2en, fr2de, fr2en, it2en, ja2en, ko2en, nl2en, ru2en, zh2en.
> As some have guessed, this is a 20% project, and while machine
> translation isn't perfect, we hope these bots can be helpful in
> bridging language barriers.
