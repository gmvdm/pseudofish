[Strobist][] has inspired my purchase of a set of three Pocket Wizards.
Rather than spend heaps of time talking about them, I've included some
of the information I found useful.

</p>

The following video explains how they work:

My setup now includes three Pocket Wizards, a Canon 350d, a Canon 430ex
(and PC sync adaptor), a Nikon SB-26, and I also made a 2.5mm - 3.5mm
mono cord to connect the Pocket Wizard to the wired trigger port on my
camera.

</p>

The [eBay remotes][] are a cheaper option, but don't include the ability
to remote trigger a camera and aren't as reliable. Make sure to get the
version 2 ones if you are shooting Canon. They provided a good way for
me to get my feet wet, and helped justify the PW purchase.

<u>Bonus</u>: [Sports Shooter][] shows some cool uses for remote
cameras.
