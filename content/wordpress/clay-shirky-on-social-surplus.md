Brilliant, brilliant [article][]. Go. Read. [Now][article].

Some highlights:

> So if you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit, all of Wikipedia, the
> whole project--every page, every edit, every talk page, every line of
> code, in every language that Wikipedia exists in--that represents
> something like the cumulation of 100 million hours of human thought. I
> worked this out with Martin Wattenberg at IBM; it's a
> back-of-the-envelope calculation, but it's the right order of
> magnitude, about *100 million hours of thought*.
>
> And television watching? Two hundred billion hours, in the U.S. alone,
> every year. Or put still another way, in the U.S., we spend *100
> million hours* every weekend, just watching the ads.
>
> Now, the interesting thing about a surplus like that is that society
> doesn't know what to do with it at first--hence the gin, hence the
> sitcoms. Because if people knew what to do with a surplus with
> reference to the existing social institutions, then it wouldn't be a
> surplus, would it? It's precisely when no one has any idea how to
> deploy something that people have to start experimenting with it, in
> order for the surplus to get integrated, and the course of *that
> integration can transform society*.

> In this same conversation with the TV producer I was talking about
> World of Warcraft guilds, and as I was talking, I could sort of see
> what she was thinking: "Losers. Grown men sitting in their basement
> pretending to be elves."
>
> At least they're doing something.

The cost of [participating][] in social media seems like small change
given the cognitive surplus from turning the TV off.
