MacSlash has opened up the forums for discussion on [Finding Cocoa
Developers][]. This topic should provide interesting reading for
developers looking for where to go job hunting and also for employers
looking for developers.

I can agree with the comment:

> Cocoa has a TOUGH learning curve

Even replacing Objective-C with Python (thanks to [PyObjC][]), Cocoa is
still a large set of APIs and not something one can master overnight.
