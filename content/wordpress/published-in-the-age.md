I was lucky and in the right place at the right time with a camera.

[Phil][] needed a portrait submitted to the Age for an article about
Astronomy. While we were down at [camp][] last week, I took the
opportunity to make a few of him.

We tried out a few styles, and the photo that ran didn't make it into my
final selects. But then I wasn't looking at the portrait purely for an
editorial piece.

This is the photo used:

These are my two favorites from the shoot:
