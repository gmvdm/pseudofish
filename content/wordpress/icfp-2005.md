The [Dylan Hackers][] have done a very good job at the ICFP 2005
programming content. There has been some [media coverage][], and the
team themselves have done a [very good write up][Dylan Hackers].

Personally, I hadn't heard anything about Dylan as a language before
today however the above quote seems quite telling. Haskell was the other
language to have a high level of success at the competition taking out
the win, with second and the judges prize going to the Dylan team.

</p>

Entries were submitted in a range of languages, and over the years, it
has consistently been the languages with high abstraction that allow
programmers to focus on the problem at hand that have done the best.

I remember back when I was at [uni][] that our [Mercury][] team had done
well at [this competition][] for a similar reason. Mercury being a nice
language which is to Prolog what Haskell is to Lisp, it provides a high
level abstraction of a computing model while still being fast enough for
daily use.
