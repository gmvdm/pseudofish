Joseph Pine's [talk][] at TED really has me thinking.

This is a table outlining the difference between the types of economic
output, using the example of coffee.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Economic Output</th>
<th>Business Imperative</th>
<th>Consumer Sensitivity</th>
<th>Coffee Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Experience</td>
<td>Render</td>
<td>Authenticity</td>
<td>$5.00 per cup (*Starbucks*)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service</td>
<td>Improve</td>
<td>Quality</td>
<td>$1.00 per cup (*coffee shop*)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goods</td>
<td>Control</td>
<td>Costs</td>
<td>$0.10 per cup (*supermarket*)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commodity</td>
<td>Supply</td>
<td>Availability</td>
<td>$0.02 per cup (*coffee beans*)</td>
</tr>
</table>

The drive to software-as-a-service makes the software industry jump to
service. It takes Apple to move it to an experience. Disney is another
example of experience based economics.

I like this framework for thinking about what business I am working in.
The trick will be to figure out how move up the ladder to render an
authentic experience.

His [book][] is now on my to-read list.
