From [Seth][]:

> If marketing is the art of spreading ideas, then teaching is a kind of
> marketing.

[Atex][] is a company that understands this very well.

They make a very complex and hard to understand set of products.
Training is kept as an in-house competency. In fact, training is often
included for a select group of key staff within a newspaper as part of
the pre-sales process. The training isn't conducted by an outsourced
company, or by a junior employee, but by the best expert available on
the system.

This makes the sales process much smoother, as the customer now
understands the product and the *value* that the product brings to their
business.

Do not underestimate the value of training, it may just help close your
next deal!
