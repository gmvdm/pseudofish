My initial reaction to the [teasers][] for 3.0 was excitement. My
understanding of the opening up of the accessory port to developers
would allow for fun innovation. I was wrong.

The dream I had was to be able to connect my iPhone, via USB, to my
camera(s). This would allow my phone to act as a remote control, and as
an external screen for photos & video. The [gPhoto][] libraries looked
like they could provide a starting point.

What is actually provided doesn't allow for straight USB connectivity.

The External Accessory support requires a validated accessory, with
appropriate hardware protocols, to work. You also need to be a member of
two programs, iPhone Developer and the [Made for iPod program][].

I can't see Canon or Nikon releasing cameras with iPod dock connectors
or protocols.

This doesn't leave many options. One is to build a hardware device that
is USB in one end and a custom protocol out the other. This gets tricky
fast as the hardware device needs to figure out the camera support. And
I really liked the idea of a simple cable connection being all that is
required.

The second option still has some merit: WiFi. There are a few downsides.
Firstly, you need a camera that supports WiFi or an expensive adaptor.
This limits the audience for the app. Secondly, you need a wireless
network available and to also manage pairing between your iPhone and
your camera. This starts to be more equipment than desirable.

If you have a laptop lying around, onOne software [released][] such an
[iPhone app][].
