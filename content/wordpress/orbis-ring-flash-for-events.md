The [Orbis Ring flash][] is a low budget option for using portable
strobes to power a ring flash. There are two big advantages to the
Orbis: light & cheap. That said, the build quality is very solid and
more than I was expecting.

I decided to try mine out at a friend's housewarming. This was the
result:

To shoot with, it was a breeze. My SB-24 mounted snug in the adaptor. An
old sync cord linked my 5D2 to the flash and I was away. The results
were impressive.

For shooting an event, such as a party or a wedding, the ring flash
gives a nice fall off of light without too much in the way of
highlights. For candid portraits, it was simply wow.

I'm looking forward to trying it out in a more staged environment. There
are a few lighting options I'd like to try, such as using it for fill or
using it from off-axis.

The Orbis team has put a few videos on [YouTube][], and there is a group
of [Flickr][] showing what people are doing with it.
