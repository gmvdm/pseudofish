Title: A New Theory on Brains

[Jeff Hawkins][]' TED talk on brain science got me thinking. He posits
that the act of thinking is about predicting, rather than about
behavior. This model of reasoning makes sense, and will simplify the
computer modeling of thought.

</p>

What I find interesting is that our own brian is not great at
prediction. We are making progress in the study of our own biases and
their impact on prediction and decision making.

</p>

For discussion, "[Judgement under Uncertainty][]" is a must read; a
collection of papers on our known biases.

</p>

When we computerize this model, do we introduce the same or similar
biases? Does it make sense in silicon, to recreate our own limitations?
What happens when we invent a new form of consciousness with bias
removed?
