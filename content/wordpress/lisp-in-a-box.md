I like to learn programming by doing. After many attempts to learn Lisp
by reading, I tried by doing. Much higher level of success!

The turning point was finding the online version of [Practical Common
Lisp][]. Aside from being a great book, it also includes a bundled Lisp
and Emacs package called - [Lispbox][]. This provides similar
functionality to other languages, such as hugs/ghci for Haskell or the
python interpreter.

A [quick download][] for any major platform and you have a Lisp prompt
waiting for you to type something useful. Start reading the book and you
learn something useful to type.

Peter Seibel has done a terrific job with this book. The tone used
involves the reader in the Lisp world with glimpses into the long
history of Lisp. All of this with a practical approach to learning. By
the end of the book, a streaming Mp3 server is possible!

Lisp macros have started to make sense to me (help!). Try to think of
being allowed to write any C++ code to generate the expansion of a
\#define and having the C preprocessor know what you meant. Very, very
powerful.

Why am I learning Lisp? One theory is [Sapir-Whorf][]:

Possibly. My main reason is that it looked fun. I've spent a bit of time
playing with languages that owe a lot to Lisp. It made sense to have a
look at Lisp and see for myself. The scary part is that I may stay a
while ... writing [web services][] in Lisp is awfully tempting.
