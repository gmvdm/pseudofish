Obviously attempting to write Cocoa applications in [Python][] would
require some knowledge of the language. Fortunately, there is some very
good [documentation][] including a very easy to read [tutorial][].

If you were looking for a way to progress further, you could consider
some online [challenges][]. And as with most games, there is an online
[spoiler][], which will help if stuck on the first few, but you won't
learn as much.

There are also some good books available, but I haven't read any so
can't recommend a good one.

Thanks go to Apple for including python on Mac OS X, which means you can
start from the Terminal:

    gmwils@mayumi % python
    Python 2.3.5 (#1, Mar 20 2005, 20:38:20)
    >>> 2**38
    274877906944L

My own route to learning python was that I was sick of [perl][], didn't
want to use Visual Basic and needed to do some COM programming on Win32.
Having previously spent way too long coding in [Haskell][], I've jumped
into python with somewhat of a content sigh. I'm actually happy coding
again :)

Now that I can use Python for Windows programming I'm going to try to
dodge Objective C on my way to Cocoa programming.
