Title: New Blog

If things went well, this post will be from my new blog.

I migrated my existing blog across to use
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/), a static site generator written in
Python. This is part of attempting to use emacs & python for as much of my
workflow as possible.

During the migration, all the code and formatting were cleaned up, so it
should be easy to change. Previously, all the content was in a Wordpress
database, and not so easy to transform.

I'm not sure how attached I'll be to Markdown. I am contemplating adding
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) support to Pelican, as I use it for most other
notetaking.

You may notice some duplicate articles via RSS. This is unfortunately due to
changing the URL scheme.
