In [this article][] Damian Conway outlines ten development practices
that he considers essential for developing big, business critical
systems. Also, incredibly useful for developing big, user critical Cocoa
programs.

The examples are in Perl, but the development practices are basic good
practice and can be applied to any language.

A short summary:

1.  Design the Module's Interface First
2.  Write the Test Cases Before the Code
3.  Create Standard Documentation Templates for Modules and Applications
4.  Use a Revision Control System
5.  Create Consistent (Command-Line / User) Interfaces
6.  Agree Upon a Coherent Layout Style and Automate It (with perltidy)
7.  Code in Commented Paragraphs
8.  Throw Exceptions Instead of Returning Special Values or Setting
    Flags
9.  Add New Test Cases Before you Start Debugging
10. Don't Optimize Code--Benchmark It
