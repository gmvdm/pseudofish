[Clay Shirky][] has a great article up about the history of
classifications of things (ontologies).

With movements afoot on the great Semantic Web, which seem to be way too
bogged down in theory without significant practical applications, he
asks the question of "Where to now?"

His theory is that the concept of tagging things (much like a blog post
or a del.icio.us link) will take us to the next level of knowledge
integration. Search having been the light to come out of the
categorisation of [old][].

As an aside, it is interesting how the categorisation of things follows
the [Long Tail][]. And it is the ability of tagging to support the long
tail that will help it survive.
