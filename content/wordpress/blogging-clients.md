[![Long Road Home][]][]

[MarsEdit][] is my long standing blogging client of choice. I loathe
trying to write blog posts in a web browser. Version 1 of MarsEdit was a
god send.

Version 2 brings some newness, such as Flickr integration and a slicker
user interface. The best thing is the new features not detracting from
the existing tool. Just how a new release ought be.

</p>

If you are stuck on the Windows platform, as I often am, [Windows Live
Writer][] is another good tool. Similar feature set to MarsEdit, somehow
not as much fun.

</p>

If only I could sync drafts between the two ...
