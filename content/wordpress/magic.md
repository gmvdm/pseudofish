One of my favorite quotes!

</p>

<p>
> </p>
>
> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
>
> </p>
>
> *Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of The Future", 1961 (Clarke's third
> law)*

On a recent trip to Germany, opened my dictionary from high school and
found prose that I recorded:

</p>

<p>
> </p>
>
> The kernel of all jealousy is a lack of love
>
> </p>
>
> *- C. Jung*
>
> </p>
> <p>

</p>

<p>
> </p>
>
> Courage, love, friendship,  
>
> Compassion, and empathy  
>
> Lift us above the simple beasts  
>
> And define humanity.
>
> </p>
>
> *- The Book of Counted Sorrows*
>
> </p>
> <p>

</p>

And one more discovered recently:

</p>
<p>
> </p>
>
> Beauty must be constantly recreated as truth
>
> </p>
>
> *- jean-christophe ammann*
>
> </p>
> <p>
