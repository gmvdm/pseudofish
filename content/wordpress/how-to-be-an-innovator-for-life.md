[Tom Kelly][], of the design and development firm IDEO, gives a
brilliant speech at Stanford's [ETL program][].

He breaks innovation down into five habits:

-   Think like a traveller; be child like with a sense of wonder &
    exploration.
-   Treat life as an experiment; be willing to fail provided learning is
    attached.
-   Nurture an attitude of wisdom.
-   Use your whole brain (and your tortoise mind).
-   Follow your passions.

The ETL series is available as a podcast on iTunes and continues to be a
valuable resource.
