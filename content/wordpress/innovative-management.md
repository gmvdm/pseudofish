> There’s a market for talent, and as long as you’re willing to pay what
> that marketplace demands, you can attract talented people. The real
> challenge is making profits off those talented people. That’s where
> the big opportunity is. The leading companies today are combining
> talent and technology and organizational design to generate much
> higher profits per employee than was possible in the past. So the
> trick becomes, “How do I hire talent that I can profit from?”

> In any field of human endeavor you ultimately reach a point where you

> the principles upon which our modern companies are
> built—standardization, specialization, hierarchy, and so on—you
> realize that those are not bad principles but are inadequate for the
> challenges that lie ahead.
