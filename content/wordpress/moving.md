-   I'm moving industries, from the [media industry][], to a new start
    in [telecommunications][].

    Four years working for internet providers, and four years providing
    software solutions to newspapers -- mobile devices are the next
    round of design constraints to learn.

-   I'm moving residence, from Melbourne to a city up the coast,
    Brisbane.

    Not quite an overseas move, but a substantial geographical shift.
    Having lived in Melbourne for as long as I can remember,
    [Brisvegas][] will be interesting.

-   I'm moving eating habits, from omnivore to vegetarian.

    After a month, have yet to start craving meat, and have learnt that
    pickled ginger is the garnish for sushi, not strips of salmon.

And, this site has moved from a bedroom in Melbourne to a data centre in
the United States. A big thanks to [Jeremy][] for a seamless transition!
