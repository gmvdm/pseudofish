There will be no 12" MacBook Pro.

I'm a long time fan of the 12" PowerBook. Mine served me for more years
than it should have. It is now being retired for use as a media center,
as a black MacBook replaces it.

Almost everything is better. Nicer screen, faster processor, more
memory, Intel Inside; you know the list.

The performance really is something. It will take some time to stop
waiting for things to happen. Haskell code compiles quickly. And
Ligthroom, my main reason for upgrading, is even more productive!

Here's what I miss from my 12" PB:

-   Industrial design - little things like rounded edges, the PB is nice
    to touch.
-   Keyboard - the MacBook keyboard isn't as nice to type on.
-   Size - not much bigger but the MacBook isn't as convenient as the
    12"
-   Heat - the PB stayed cooler than the MacBook, especially on long
    compiles

Otherwise, it is pretty much the same as the 12" PowerBook. This goes
right down to the display adaptors. The SVideo/RGB video adaptor from my
PowerBook works a treat. But I'm really going to miss the industrial
design niceties from the Pro.
