[Mobilizing Minds][] takes the ideas from a range of sources, including
the [Origins of Wealth][] and the authors own experiences, to create a
blueprint for the 21^st^ century organization.

It adds to the extensive literature on the *[War for Talent][]*, but
with a twist. Rather than compete on talent acquisition, compete using
talent utilization; getting the most out of the people you already have.

The journey covers all aspects of the firm, including organization,
strategy, resource allocation and basic mindsets.

> Through the POI (*Portfolio of Initiatives*) process, then, the
> company can grow entrepreneurs. And these will be the individuals who
> can create new wealth in the 21^st^ century.

No one company currently embodies all of the ideas in this book (the
authors create a fictitious company to discuss), however the ideas are
turning up in many of the successful companies of recent times.

For example: Google allocates staff using a talent marketplace, GE and
Microsoft manage strong portfolios of initiatives (POI) and several
companies are starting to manage using leadership teams (see [The Will
to Lead][] for more on this).

If you are looking for a good summary of managing a firm in the 21^st^
century firm, this is a great book. It is a good blend of theory and
practical application that I've not found in other books.

People at my company are going to be hearing many of these ideas over
the coming months as I believe it possible to realize some of the
benefits. Not that it will be easy. Some of the basic metrics for
measuring progress, such as profit per employee, can be quite complex to
calculate.
