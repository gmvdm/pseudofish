Agile is something that I've previously found to work very well with
in-house R&D projects, and rather more challenging when negotiating
projects with customers.

The challenge is getting from the sales cycle through to the agile
development iterations, be they sprints or otherwise.

By using an agile process, the advantage is that many smart people have
been here before. Some of the knowledge is locked up in consultancy
houses, while some of it is shared.

Gerard Meszaros has a [good presentation][] highlighting some of the
challenges and what often gets missed. The slides are available
[here][].

For me, this is the key slide:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>
The section on adding more time into the *Product Planning* phase fits
well with how customers often see projects. By providing scope at the
feature level, it allows boundaries to be placed around time and money.

This is certainly an area of agile that I would like to understand more.
